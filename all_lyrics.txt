aVThank you Ms. Graham for coming today. You look very nice today, sorry, that's not professional, I guess. They say in Canada, don't mingle business with pleasure, or something like that So, we have to talk about Aubrey, or how he likes to be called, Drake. As I always like to say, there is room for improvement in his learning from piano. He talks a lot, huh? He socialize when I'm teaching. Okay, and when it's time for him to play, he doesn't have pianist hands. If you need example: me, Mozart, and Ray Charles all of us have pianist hands. I'm the only one living with this hands, I guess. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding. Umm it seems like he likes the music and he obviously has a reason, but there is so much room for improvement, you know? Speaking of improvement, I don't think you, Ms. Graham need any of it. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding, haha

p5216
aVI met this new girl late June or early July\u000aI called her a bunch of times but she barely replied
p5217
aVNow it's December, I'm driving, and she's like "Where's my hi?"
p5218
aVIt's weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy
p5219
aVSee that was a segue,
p5220
aVI believe the matter\u000aIs what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter
p5221
aVWhere the Timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up\u000aDrug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up\u000aWhere girls become exes from Summer's caught ho'in\u000aThe winter cars come out, the summer cars go in
p5222
aVAnd some places is breezy, and some it start snow-ing\u000aAnd if you planning family vacations you better know when
p5223
aVBut some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city\u000aInstead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity\u000aCause mom stays up late, she seen them videos\u000aWhere Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!
p5224
aVYeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man\u000aA lot of girls y'know, wanna get close. you might think they the one\u000aBut just wait, nah mean, take it slow
p5225
aVForget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach
p5226
aVShe lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet\u000aSince I'm driving, I ask her how to get to the suite
p5227
aVShe doesn't answer
p5228
aVopens the door and just gets in the seat\u000aShe throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat
p5229
aVShe's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet
p5230
aVThen she says "I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat\u000aI mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat\u000aI love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good\u000aThere's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat"
p5231
aVOff this I'm kinda takin it back for a second
p5232
aVI get her number she tells me to call her after this session
p5233
aVAnd so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch
p5234
aVUntil we end up sexin' and now my heart attached
p5235
aVI'm thinkin off I should've been more Southern
p5236
aVShe love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench
p5237
aVBut, my boy say I'm actin different, because I lay downtown\u000aAnd I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench
p5238
aVShe tellin everyone I'mma hold here down\u000aTell everyone I'm the prince up in this cold clear town\u000aAnd stupid me I just listen to her
p5239
aVInstead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round
p5240
aVBut then Spring shows up, and it's Dallas in this bitch
p5241
aVThe weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
p5242
aVWhen we were together it seeming like way back when\u000aBall players hop on the plane and make it way back in\u000aSee she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa
p5243
aVInstead of saving for marriage, she saving for carrabanna
p5244
aVAnd it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime\u000aI guess, I lost another one to the wintertime
p5245
aV(give me a second to gather my thoughts)\u000aAnd watching winter turn to spring (Such a beautiful day man)\u000a(Yeah man, you know we had to switch it on 'em right?)\u000aStrolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing\u000a(I'm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss)\u000a(Man, but I got something to else to tell ya baby)
p5246
aVI remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up
p5247
aVNow Drake's committed we waiting on the breakup
p5248
aVSo we can get back to them cognac nights\u000aWith dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right\u000aAnd I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
p5249
aVThe winter came and blew his cold air through\u000aBack then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her\u000aBy the end of the week I would know that crew
p5250
aVAnd we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene\u000aWith three ladies in the shot we never broke routine\u000aAt the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin'
p5251
aVWe had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen
p5252
aVBut this Summer is different it's a two man operation\u000aGranted the fact that we one man short\u000aGot love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation\u000aCause handlin' crack is a one man sport
p5253
aVInstead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin'
p5254
aVI find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'\u000aThe face, the breast, the bras, the toes
p5255
aVI'm still solo and a long night draws to a close\u000aCause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside\u000aWe'll never talk again, scary and true
p5256
aVThat song Special I recorded with Voyce well it's like a classified\u000aIt's what I'm lookin for to carry me through
p5257
aVYet I can't seem to find it, every girl that possesses it
p5258
aVOnly wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit
p5259
aVAnd when they talk about they past and lovers\u000aAnd you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others
p5260
aVThere's also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive
p5261
aVStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring\u000aStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring\u000aStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring
p5262
aVAnd realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho!
p5263
aVYeah, uh, I told ya'll I had a story for you right
p5264
aVUh, ya man, it's what it is

aVWay less support from my peers\u000aIn recent years as I get established
p5415
aVWhy is my struggle different than others'?\u000aOnly child that\u2019s takin' care of his mother\u000aAs health worsens and bills double\u000aThat\u2019s not respectable all of a sudden?\u000aI don\u2019t get a pat on the back for the come up?
p5416
aVWhat do you see when you see me?\u000aWhen did all the things I mean\u000aFrom the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?\u000aMaybe I share it with too many people\u000aBack then it used to just feel like our secret\u000aBack when I would write and not think about how they receive it\u000aI be tryna manifest the things I needed\u000aAnd look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
p5417
aVBut you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all

p5419
aVJealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra

p5430
aVBe honest with myself and take ownership
p5431

aVMahalo from the hardest act to follow
p5497
aVLately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle
p5498
aVAlohas to women with no ties to men\u000aThat I know well, that way there are no lies
p5499
aVYou can thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
p5500
aVI'm on the brink of influential,
p5501
aVI'm here for you niggas
p5502
aVI guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
p5503
aVI must have been hard to watch, what a year for you niggas
p5504
aVIt's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating\u000aYou got your resolutions, we just got reservations
p5505
aVLiving out a dream it feels like I stayed up
p5506
aVAnd we just want to party, Patron straight up
p5507
aVFuck that old shit, I'm on new things\u000aOVO Clique, Red Wing Boot Gang
p5508
aVYeah we want it all, half was never the agreement\u000aWho would have thought the route we'd chosen\u000aWould ever end up the scenic?
p5509
aVI can relate to kids going straight to the league\u000aWhen they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
p5510
aVAnd that's around the time\u000aThat your idols become your rivals\u000aYou make friends with Mike\u000aBut got to A.I. him for your survival
p5511
aVDamn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous\u000aCause we want to be them, and they want to be us
p5512
aVSo on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment\u000aThat you take for granted, you can thank me now
p5513
aVAnd oh my goodness you're welcome, you're welcome
p5514
aVAt this point me is who I am trying to save myself from
p5515
aVRappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them\u000aCause they think that I can help them\u000aGet back to where they fell from
p5516
aVBut drink up, cause everyone here is good tonight\u000aExcept the niggas that I came with, they good for life
p5517
aVThat's how you know it's going down\u000aIn case another chance never comes around
p5518
aVShallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
p5519
aVI think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women\u000aI think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me I'll miss it\u000aCause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
p5520
aVMan, the good girls went silent on me\u000aThey got a boyfriend, or left for college on me\u000aAnd all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now\u000aThat make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
p5521
aVBut do I ever come up in discussion\u000aOver double pump lattes and low fat muffins?
p5522
aVDo I? Or is missing what we had out of the question?\u000aI'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
p5523
aVI got flows for the Marilyn Monroes\u000aWho was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes
p5524
aVThey hear about your cons, but focus on your pros\u000aAnd love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
p5525
aVBut those same ones from your area will grow into women\u000aThat are ready to get married at hello
p5526
aVBecause of what they allowed,
p5527
aVwhere are they all now?\u000aI know they're somewhere watching\u000aSo I'm trying to make them proud
p5528
aVSearching for the meaning, you'll find it next to me
p5529
aVThey tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see
p5530
aVI'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?
p5531
aVThey say the doors will open up\u000aSoon as you find the missing key
p5532
aVThat's probably why I'm in this bitch shining
p5533
aVJump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
p5534
aVI rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
p5535
aVAnd the bandwagon's full\u000aBut you can try and run behind it, I'm sorry
p5536
aVPoolside drinking, Margarita rounds
p5537
aVShout out to my city though I hardly be in town
p5538
aVI'm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown
p5539
aVAnd I know life is just a game\u000aIn which the cards are facing down
p5540
aVI'm in a world where things are taken, never given
p5541
aVHow long they choose to love you will never be your decision\u000aAnd I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen\u000aSo while I'm still here in this position
p5542
aVFalling too fast
p5543
aVClearly rules don't apply
p5544
aVCan't believe that I just met you
p5545
aVYou got me here\u000aWatching minutes past by
p5546
aVWondering when to expect you
p5547
aVThere you go\u000aIs this a dream?
p5548
aVLooking like every picture\u000aThat I've seen of you before
p5549
aVI've seen it all before
p5550
aVNow that it's over\u000aI should of known better\u000aThen you think this is real and\u000aYou could be mine
p5551
aVI should have known better\u000aSlowed it down cause I feel\u000aYou needed time
p5552
aVBut I kept thinking\u000aThis could be something\u000aThis could be something\u000aThis could be something\u000aThis could be\u000aThis could be\u000aThis could be something\u000aThis could be something\u000aThis could be something
p5553
aVMaybe it's just nothing at all
p5554

aVYou know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I\u2019m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days.

p7186
aVThey just tell you all the rumors they heard\u000aAnd we laugh soon as you come and tell me like Amel and Bryce\u000aMy groove theory
p7187
aVThat's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
p7188
aVAnd if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it
p7189
aVBut I hate it when they judge me on how I sound\u000aI mean I spit that influential shit from my town
p7190
aVYou probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and\u000aSwang dick to these hoes like nunchucks\u000aWell, you can think what you want but\u000aI think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut
p7191
aVYou need to get real and check out my real life\u000aI ain't a tip-drill, don't care what it smell like\u000aBut if you feel like putting all your notions aside\u000aAnd talking to a real nigga, I'd gladly oblige
p7192
aVFirst name Phonte, I'd be pleased to date ya\u000aCollege educated, got degrees in papers
p7193
aVMaybe with me you'll unlearn\u000aPutting all niggas in a box of concerns
p7194
aVThey say you never judge a book by its cover\u000aThough you appear as materialistic, just like the others
p7195
aVSo I followed your words to take 'em in\u000aAnd I don't see what you saying so they coming off paper thin\u000aThat's when I felt that I would need to\u000aDo more than just look you up and down to see if I could read you
p7196
aVYou only out for the paperback that's written all over your face\u000aNo El' will never judge a book by its cover
p7197
aVDon't judge me man
p7198
aVThey tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
p7199
aVThey say we lack substance
p7200
aVMe, 'Te and El' bout to prove 'em wrong though
p7201
aVUh, we know what you're thinking love
p7202
aVYou think we out smoking and drinking love
p7203
aVPushing big whips, chains clinking love
p7204
aVBut y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
p7205
aVWe know how you speculate
p7206
aVThinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
p7207
aV, love
p7208
aVis that when you too cheery
p7209
aVThey try to bring you down to the level they at
p7210
aVWell when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
p7211
aVBut, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart girl
p7212
aVNah, they probably think I'll break your heart girl
p7213
aVHaha, I can't lie, you probably right about it
p7214
aVI don't know why you sitting on the couch
p7215
aVWhen you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
p7216
aVYou think taking your purse off
p7217
aVWill lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
p7218
aVAt least I got status because I could've been a local emcee
p7219
aVAnd you probably would've been worse off
p7220
aVSo I'mma take this hat off, and I'mma hit it till I'm back soft
p7221
aVAnd then I backs off
p7222
aVCause you thinking you can predict what happen
p7223
aVYou the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping
p7224
aVBut I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping
p7225
aVOr rapping bout trapping you's a freak of nature
p7226
aVSuch an anomaly, speak so well
p7227
aVAnd talk so collegy, such an astonishing
p7228
aVContrast to all the bullshit you've been following
p7229
aVOn behalf of them, I offer my apologies
p7230
aVMe, cause I ain't dumb, shit I'm well read like sunburn
p7231
aVAnd after me you'll never leave no stone unturned
p7232
aVAnd try to get inside your head only
p7233
aVNot just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me
p7234
aVSo what I learned on my path to discover?
p7235
aVYour story took one ugly turn after another
p7236
aVI saw we wasn't on the same page
p7237
aVI would've gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way
p7238
aVSo now I'm closing the case
p7239
aVUntil he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under
p7240
aVVery few give you that truth, it's either they can't do it with lyrics\u000aOr can't do it in spirit
p7241
aVthey cancel what they doin'\u000aThe samples that they usin'
p7242
aVMy father's early careerin' forced my parents to split up
p7243
aVMy mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up\u000aWith just being a florist
p7244
aVhe got back into doin' what he was doing before us
p7245
aVBecause money is an issue, your son, he gon' miss you\u000aAnd plus you got a wife at home cause mommy still exist too
p7246
aVNow you lookin' for exes, you ain't never expect this
p7247
aVYou end up doing time
p7248
aVme, I end up with a step-sis
p7249
aVNobody passing judgment, they question where the drugs went\u000aYou know I hold you down because without you, I'd be a wasn't
p7250
aVAnd you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers\u000aIT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!
p7251
aVThis is my life, and so the rest has kinda been cool\u000aQuestion what I been through\u000aI write a verse addressin' it\u000aAnd yes I might offend you
p7252
aVPicture when I was in school
p7253
aVMe being the closest thing to black\u000aAnd guess what rap music what I was into
p7254
aVNow I'm grown I can say what it is
p7255
aVIt's parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raisin' they kids
p7256
aVAnd your daddy want it very right\u000aI make you happy, plus I'm Jewish, he don't approve
p7257
aVI think he want you to marry white\u000aHe want Sinatra at the wedding, not Barry White
p7258
aVAnd so I never been for dinner at they places
p7259
aVLike girls with Double D's, I got a lot on my chest
p7260
aVwhen I'm dismissed after a tedious listen\u000aI sit at home and say I should of been a pediatrician
p7261
aVAn artist like Pablo, maybe Petey's assistant
p7262
aVSo, if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady\u000aDaughter, and her grandson, nigga get the handgun
p7263
aVLast couple of months I done probably been around the world and back
p7264

p7272
aV, and
p7273
aVAnd mommy I'mma support her, I keep it all in order
p7274
aVSee her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border
p7275

p7276
aVI got stress on my shoulders
p7277
aVTrying to keep my heart pure but this world is makin' it colder

p7287
aVCause black is black honey, even if he's very light
p7288
aVAlways brutally honest, and so I pin it to they faces
p7289
aVI live it so the case is, whether Drake is
p7290
aVWay ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist
p7291
aVAm I hot as the rest? should I strive for my spot as the best?
p7292
aVThere's questions that need to be answered that's not on the test
p7293
aVInstead of starin' at quizzes now it's models with breasts
p7294
aVAnd yes,
