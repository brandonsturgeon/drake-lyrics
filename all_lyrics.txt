p2

p15
aVThank you Ms. Graham for coming today. You look very nice today, sorry, that's not professional, I guess. They say in Canada, don't mingle business with pleasure, or something like that So, we have to talk about Aubrey, or how he likes to be called, Drake. As I always like to say, there is room for improvement in his learning from piano. He talks a lot, huh? He socialize when I'm teaching. Okay, and when it's time for him to play, he doesn't have pianist hands. If you need example: me, Mozart, and Ray Charles all of us have pianist hands. I'm the only one living with this hands, I guess. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding. Umm it seems like he likes the music and he obviously has a reason, but there is so much room for improvement, you know? Speaking of improvement, I don't think you, Ms. Graham need any of it. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding, haha

p373
aVHope that I see you, see you
p374
aVLately I don't know about the friends that I hang with
p375
aVI'm nervous round my boys, it depends on their anguish
p376
aVDepends on if they saving all the tops on pepsi
p377
aVWith dreams of seeing girls topless on jet skis
p378
aVDepends on what they do to achieve that
p379
aVRobbing r&b singers, 'specially if they know where the keys at
p380
aV'specially if they know where they girl live
p381
aVGet the info, leave with ya money man, thats how the world is
p382
aVThats how niggas puttin they dirt down
p383
aVHow can we be so aware of these problems and not advance?
p384
aV, its hard just to fit in
p385
aVBut I don't think that they understood
p386
aVNot bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good
p387
aVfreakin players
p388
aVOmar
p389
aVhigher learning
p390
aVTrying to excel with the brake on\u000aI'll have you stuck in the same spot\u000aWith the tires burnin'
p391
aVAnd I'm a liar turnin' 19, jaded with no faith\u000aIn any female that's askin what I was earnin
p392
aVI met this recent lady\u000aShe knew a piece of sadey by spinners
p393
aVI guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe
p394
aVIt's like I'm using some bread to sop up some decent gravy\u000aNow I'm out of both and I've been thinkin' of Aleshia lately
p395
aVLove's lost\u000aLove's gone\u000aLove lost\u000aLove is gone
p396
aVThey get to first bases\u000aThen they get to retreating cause if she cheatin'\u000aHe wanna know what the first trace is
p397
aVI had to take it back a couple a years\u000aWhen some of the best kicked it with Drake in fact
p398
aVEither way I'm all alone, got a feelin' it's on\u000aCause nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin' is gone and uh
p399
aVAnd nowadays some girls are the type of person that\u000aWill tell they friends that they use him which is confusing\u000aSince I ain't made them a purchase yet
p400
aVBut there's logic behind it\u000aEmotions double and they try to cover up\u000aLike a mansion with the projects behind it
p401
aVBut golddiggin' is nothing when you can shovel for days\u000aAnd come up with tin foil
p402
aVCollectively I look for a proper chick that'll rep for me\u000aInstead of seeing something she wants and calling and texting me
p403
aVLove's lost
p404
aVLove's gone
p405
aVLove lost
p406
aVLove is gone
p407
aVLook
p408
aVIn this world of desperate housewives and
p409
aVRappers they tend to be smilin'
p410
aVBecause they swimmin' in women
p411
aVMost of em seeking favors
p412
aVThey come in secret flavors
p413
aVThat's why I envy
p414
aVBecause so far I'm nowhere close to Malik and Deja
p415
aVAnd that's some
p416
aVWell second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby
p417
aVCause she ain't give me the butterflies that Aleshia gave me
p418
aVI'm all alone, I got a feelin it's on
p419
aVCause nowadays most of the thrill of chillin' is gone and uh
p420
aVSome dudes they turn purple with hurt faces
p421
aVCircling workplaces
p422
aVAnd following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is
p423
aVNow you like Macgyver
p424
aVCause you sneakin' around
p425
aVAnd she don't know that you there when you standin' right beside her
p426
aVI can relate to that
p427
aVI bet that they knew it cause in my mind I play through it with
p428
aVAnd in the end I listen but I don't see me as they do
p429
aVCause it's my opinion, my life, my potentials for my wife
p430
aVAnd I used to be eager to buy em the world
p431
aVMaybe I'm confused about what I desire from girls
p432
aVCheck
p433
aVI tend to freak with this
p434
aVI get a girl and pretend that I love the spending
p435
aVAnd all she gave was a decent kiss
p436
aVThinking she been spoiled
p437
aVWe could dissect it see
p438
aVYou take a Dominique or another freak in the sheets
p439
aVAnd you picture that she just slept with me for nothing
p440
aVGave her nothing
p441
aVHer reputation's in jeopardy
p442
aVCause it ain't take a spree of that shopping to get her next to me
p443
aVFor thinking that exists, I got a feeling I'm wrong
p444
aVNowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh
p445
aVLook, if you a girl with the aspirations
p446
aVOf being in the background witcha asses shakin
p447
aVHittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin

aVHustlers give you events
p462
aVBouncers give you pass

p466
aVAnd start rolling together like snoopy and woodstock
p467
aVDaffy and bugs, its all laughing and hugs
p468
aVTil the dude catch a plane
p469
aVAnd she back where she was
p470

p471
aVIts a shame cause now at his window
p472
aVShe throwin bricks like shaq in the clutch
p473
aVYou can see thats shes colder
p474
aVCuz he doesnt hold her
p475
aVFall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder
p476
aVKnow that he tried ta told her
p477
aVThat he couldn't mold her
p478
aVIf this the type of chick you wanna be when you older, I say
p479
aVNow up north theres five artists deservin a listen
p480
aVAnd I'm one of em, the other four you know who you are
p481
aVBut if you gotta think through
p482
aVChances are that it ain't you
p483
aVI singlehandedly carry out what you can't do
p484
aVAnd see I take a couple of breathers
p485
aVAnd then things come together on the spot like a couple thats eager
p486
aVIf you wanna pack a duffel and leave her
p487
aVGo ahead, I couldn't give two damns like a couple of beavers
p488
aVWhenever I'm out in memphis the man seen as trill
p489
aVAnd every verse the man seem to kill
p490
aVYou can find him with black jays and socks like I'm andreena mill
p491
aVJapan and brazil, the audience acreaming
p492
aVAnd then you come around and all the fans seems to chill
p493
aVAdvances to deals, financing appeals
p494
aVThe hustles, I have you feeling like you dancing in heels and uh
p495
aVIf you a girl with the aspirations

p501
aVAnd purses are light now\u000aShe use 'em all the time
p502
aVBut she got less sense than a empty perfume bottle
p503
aVshe all up in the closet so much\u000aGot a hunch thats shes feelin other women
p504
aVI'm in a bad position
p505
aVI wouldn't call her name\u000aI got the feelin that they all the same
p506
aVLook, you tell your parents that its cash at an easy pace
p507
aVBut you ain't thandie newton, and this ain't crash here
p508
aVRegina Hall and Garcelle and Elise Neal\u000aYoung girls these here women with big dreams\u000aRole models that you can watch on the big screen
p509
aVAnd I ain't trying ta generalize every video girl, you n'a mean?

aVThe ceiling could be higher
p512
aVShe making requests
p513

p533
aVLook at Vida Guerrera
p534
aVThere's no need to compare her
p535
aVI bet she smiles cuz she loves what she sees in the mirror
p536
aVI bet she's out meetin' directors instead
p537
aVAnd frustrated cause shes already been undressed in they head
p538
aVBe a teacher, open up shop if you can do nails fine
p539
aVApply for a business loan and I'll bet you that they'll sign

aVOr pasha and sasha, esther baxter
p546
aVMelyssa ford, or katy or anyone after

p557
aVAnd he ask questions later and pat down first
p558
aVThe resolutions passed baby, this ain't last year
p559
aVLook, I got a message, I'll say it

p577
aVShe always showing up at these places she get invited
p578
aVShe a video girl
p579
aVYeah, this dedicated to Canada man
p580
aVThe whole up North\u000aA lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the Winter\u000aBut listen
p581
aVI met this new girl late June or early July\u000aI called her a bunch of times but she barely replied
p582
aVNow it's December, I'm driving, and she's like "Where's my hi?"
p583
aVIt's weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy
p584
aVSee that was a segue,
p585
aVI believe the matter\u000aIs what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter
p586
aVWhere the Timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up\u000aDrug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up\u000aWhere girls become exes from Summer's caught ho'in\u000aThe winter cars come out, the summer cars go in
p587
aVAnd some places is breezy, and some it start snow-ing\u000aAnd if you planning family vacations you better know when
p588
aVBut some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city\u000aInstead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity\u000aCause mom stays up late, she seen them videos\u000aWhere Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!
p589
aVYeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man\u000aA lot of girls y'know, wanna get close. you might think they the one\u000aBut just wait, nah mean, take it slow
p590
aVForget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach
p591
aVShe lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet\u000aSince I'm driving, I ask her how to get to the suite
p592
aVShe doesn't answer
p593
aVopens the door and just gets in the seat\u000aShe throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat
p594
aVShe's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet
p595
aVThen she says "I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat\u000aI mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat\u000aI love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good\u000aThere's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat"
p596
aVOff this I'm kinda takin it back for a second
p597
aVI get her number she tells me to call her after this session
p598
aVAnd so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch
p599
aVUntil we end up sexin' and now my heart attached
p600
aVI'm thinkin off I should've been more Southern
p601
aVShe love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench
p602
aVBut, my boy say I'm actin different, because I lay downtown\u000aAnd I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench
p603
aVShe tellin everyone I'mma hold here down\u000aTell everyone I'm the prince up in this cold clear town\u000aAnd stupid me I just listen to her
p604
aVInstead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round
p605
aVBut then Spring shows up, and it's Dallas in this bitch
p606
aVThe weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
p607
aVWhen we were together it seeming like way back when\u000aBall players hop on the plane and make it way back in\u000aSee she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa
p608
aVInstead of saving for marriage, she saving for carrabanna
p609
aVAnd it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime\u000aI guess, I lost another one to the wintertime
p610
aV(give me a second to gather my thoughts)\u000aAnd watching winter turn to spring (Such a beautiful day man)\u000a(Yeah man, you know we had to switch it on 'em right?)\u000aStrolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing\u000a(I'm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss)\u000a(Man, but I got something to else to tell ya baby)
p611
aVI remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up
p612
aVNow Drake's committed we waiting on the breakup
p613
aVSo we can get back to them cognac nights\u000aWith dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right\u000aAnd I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
p614
aVThe winter came and blew his cold air through\u000aBack then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her\u000aBy the end of the week I would know that crew
p615
aVAnd we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene\u000aWith three ladies in the shot we never broke routine\u000aAt the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin'
p616
aVWe had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen
p617
aVBut this Summer is different it's a two man operation\u000aGranted the fact that we one man short\u000aGot love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation\u000aCause handlin' crack is a one man sport
p618
aVInstead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin'
p619
aVI find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'\u000aThe face, the breast, the bras, the toes
p620
aVI'm still solo and a long night draws to a close\u000aCause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside\u000aWe'll never talk again, scary and true
p621
aVThat song Special I recorded with Voyce well it's like a classified\u000aIt's what I'm lookin for to carry me through
p622
aVYet I can't seem to find it, every girl that possesses it
p623
aVOnly wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit
p624
aVAnd when they talk about they past and lovers\u000aAnd you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others
p625
aVThere's also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive
p626
aVStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring\u000aStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring\u000aStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring
p627
aV,
p628
aVAnd realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho!
p629
aVYeah, uh, I told ya'll I had a story for you right
p630
aVUh, ya man, it's what it is
p631
aVAnd now, I'm proud to have her like Montreal to the frizzench
p632
aVYet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride
p633
aVYou special girl, don't leave me baby\u000aTo find another just like you won't be easy baby\u000aSo, at least I know where the ones at\u000aBaby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
p634
aVLook I ought to be thankful with women I have plenty of luck\u000aAnd when it comes to relationships, many is stuck
p635
aVLook at fifty you make love, thirty you have sex\u000aSomewhere around the tender age of twenty you fuck
p636
aVOr maybe before, I'm here waiting to score
p637
aVIt's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car
p638
aVNow they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore\u000aForget, wait till it's right, now it's wait till it's more\u000aWait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour
p639
aVSo they dance to attract me, advance and attack me
p640
aVTo the point that Drake compare me to Anthony Mackie
p641
aVBut once they have my pants and my khakis\u000aI tell them I'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly
p642
aVBecause, I hate waking up undressed with a dame\u000aAnd guessing her name, I hope this shit is destined to change
p643
aVI don't get it, it's like my fairy was sick
p644
aVIt's like I meet the perfect girl, and she put me through some various shit
p645
aVIt's something that I can rarely predict
p646
aVAll I know is that I can never find the love that Tyler Perry depict
p647
aVI'm guessing maybe Shemar Moore isn't really all pure
p648
aVMaybe I lie to myself and it's like a small cure
p649
aVI gotta feeling this feeling inside is something it's like and can't be all sure
p650
aVBecause really, What is a window without a car door?
p651
aVWhy I can't settle for one instead of all four?
p652
aVJason tell me I'mma have a baby by next year\u000aPsychic told me I'mma have three kids
p653
aVI don't want my daughter making a song like Teairra Mari did
p654
aVSo, I'mma change, yeah this Summer is grown\u000aI'm running along, before I raise one of my own
p655
aVBelieve me baby, Stevie baby\u000aD-R-A-K-Eezzy baby
p656
aVYeah. Ho!
p657
aVIt's Drake. Uh Uh. Ho!

p668
aVChances are most of the days you was lying around\u000aI made money thats why these girls eyeing me down
p669
aVBy nineteen I might seem destined for millions
p670
aVSee broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat
p671
aVMy money and love is separate before I commit to date her\u000aI put a split in the middle and learn to separate her
p672
aVIt ain't about the rims on my truck
p673
aVAin't about the ice on my watch
p674
aVAin't about the coupe or my truck\u000aBaby it's about the game
p675
aVWith some fresh nice ones on my feet
p676
aVAnd I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't 'bout the dough
p677
aVCause it ain't all about that no more
p678
aVWhen you ask why I hustle in the streets that's just who I be\u000aYo I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin' free
p679
aVAin't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury
p680
aVBut without it all I'm still about the game
p681
aVThe haters wanna hate, but it ain't no thing no\u000aBecause the ladies choose to love me (cause they love me for what I do)
p682
aVIt ain't about the shoes that I've got
p683
aVAin't about my dough or my rocks
p684
aVHo, Yeah, Uh huh

p785
aVAnd me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate\u000aInstead of understanding its a tune of hate\u000aThe city's mine like Oklahoma's a Sooner state\u000aAnd we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
p786
aVSo, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut

p808
aV, to perfection I'm the spitting image
p809
aVYou stay ahead of the game, I'm ahead of the practice boy

aVVery few give you that truth, it's either they can't do it with lyrics\u000aOr can't do it in spirit
p811
aVthey cancel what they doin'\u000aThe samples that they usin'
p812
aVMy father's early careerin' forced my parents to split up
p813
aVMy mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up\u000aWith just being a florist
p814
aVhe got back into doin' what he was doing before us
p815
aVBecause money is an issue, your son, he gon' miss you\u000aAnd plus you got a wife at home cause mommy still exist too
p816
aVNow you lookin' for exes, you ain't never expect this
p817

aVme, I end up with a step-sis
p819
aVNobody passing judgment, they question where the drugs went\u000aYou know I hold you down because without you, I'd be a wasn't
p820
aVAnd you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers\u000aIT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!
p821
aVThis is my life, and so the rest has kinda been cool\u000aQuestion what I been through\u000aI write a verse addressin' it\u000aAnd yes I might offend you
p822
aVPicture when I was in school
p823
aVMe being the closest thing to black\u000aAnd guess what rap music what I was into
p824
aVNow I'm grown I can say what it is
p825
aVIt's parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raisin' they kids
p826
aVAnd your daddy want it very right\u000aI make you happy, plus I'm Jewish, he don't approve
p827
aVI think he want you to marry white\u000aHe want Sinatra at the wedding, not Barry White
p828
aVAnd so I never been for dinner at they places
p829
aVLike girls with Double D's, I got a lot on my chest
p830
aVwhen I'm dismissed after a tedious listen\u000aI sit at home and say I should of been a pediatrician
p831
aVAn artist like Pablo, maybe Petey's assistant
p832
aVSo, if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady\u000aDaughter, and her grandson, nigga get the handgun
p833
aVLast couple of months I done probably been around the world and back
p834
aVYeah, Ren, M.O.F, Haha
p835
aVIt's Drake man, it's Drake man.Yeah
p836
aVAyo Ren this that gritty shit here man

p838
aVHO!
p839
aV, can't get through the clearin'
p840
aVI'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it
p841
aV, so the choir sang his chorus
p842
aVAnd
p843
aV, and
p844
aVAnd mommy I'mma support her, I keep it all in order
p845
aVSee her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border
p846
aVBut
p847
aVI got stress on my shoulders
p848
aVTrying to keep my heart pure but this world is makin' it colder
p849
aVYoung black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
p850
aVI'm just tryna live my life cuz
p851
aVMake a little money, find a bunny
p852
aVTo make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
p853
aVI'm just trying to live my life cuz
p854
aVRest of the kids were sheltered
p855
aVI never liked to fight
p856
aVBut when someone called me a "nigga"
p857
aVI'd punch em I couldn't help it
p858
aVCause black is black honey, even if he's very light
p859
aVAlways brutally honest, and so I pin it to they faces
p860
aVI live it so the case is, whether Drake is
p861
aVWay ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist
p862
aVAm I hot as the rest? should I strive for my spot as the best?
p863
aVThere's questions that need to be answered that's not on the test
p864
aVInstead of starin' at quizzes now it's models with breasts
p865
aVAnd yes,
p866
aVHomie, I probably could've been on TV consistent
p867
aVAnd my mindset is come and get me
p868
aVI'm all alone at home with my mom and grandma and ain't nobody runnin' with me
p869
aVIf not, you gon make me call the burbs out in Richmond
p870
aVThat have you niggas laying out on the curb, they some hitmen
p871
aVAnd I don't wanna question half the places Nick been
p872
aVSometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough\u000aTo feel what I'm about to say in this song
p873
aVWhen they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself\u000aAnd you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
p874
aVAnd they try to make you out as a lie
p875
aVIt's ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason\u000aIt's a lose lose why even try
p876
aVWhen your ideas so frequently get rejected
p877
aVpeople just get neglected\u000aAnd they never really know how to feel
p878
aVPhone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics\u000aAnd the motives to try and make them a mill
p879
aVYou never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks
p880
aVand\u000aNiggas wanna say that you ain't around
p881
aVI mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming\u000aThat you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town
p882
aVAnd the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin' is fresher\u000aThan most of these rappers running the game
p883
aVCertain people will copy what's in the past to turn the profit with cash\u000aThere's time I would have done it the same
p884
aVI mean I got me a Range, Also got me a guilty conscience\u000aThat made you tell anybody I meet that I rent
p885
aVSometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers\u000aAnd watched the game from the bleachers
p886
aVBecause I'm really tend to need what I spent
p887
aVIn a house that I promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time\u000aI wasted out late at the club
p888
aVInstead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I'm working hard on the winter\u000aSo this album is a labor of love
p889
aVYou say as long as I'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats\u000aThat she can rest without a toss and a turn
p890
aVBecause she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on TV\u000aThat's exactly why I often get burned
p891
aVThat there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping
p892
aVChorus: (x4)
p893
aVYou gonna try to try harder cuz
p894
aVTry harder cuz
p895
aVTry Try-Try-Try
p896
aVBut I'm gonna try to..
p897
aVWhat up, Lupe?\u000aChi-Town, check
p898
aVMy style is very Tennessee mixed with some Terry Kennedy
p899
aVPeople barely remember me from back in the day
p900
aVI done got some contacts and threw the glasses away\u000aThe time it took me to get cool was a massive delay
p901
aVIt gets boring growing up in Memphis\u000aTryna become a pro, but keep showing up apprentice
p902
aVMama probably would've done anything to prevent this\u000aCause every single time I break a board, it gets expensive
p903
aVLuckily, my aunt workin' as a nurse\u000aSo every time I needed something, she just reach up in her purse
p904
aVAnd plus, she'd always give me speeches on the first\u000aIf I'm stayin' in her house, then I need to get some work
p905
aVI tell her I was there on vacation\u000aShe said, "You need to be doing something other than skatin'
p906
aVWhy don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement?\u000aI'mma let him know that you comin', honey, he's waitin'"
p907
aVPlaying chess, looking through some old school record ads
p908
aVHe knew I didn't really wanna post here\u000aOpened up the window and told me that the coast clear
p909
aVThis is each test life's ever given me\u000aA-plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
p910
aVYes, I'm literally Larnell Lewis with a\u000aKick and a snare, a kickflip in the air
p911
aVThe kid's sick denim jeans, put a rip in a pair\u000aJust so the space ain't restricted in here, breathe again
p912
aVThink it's obvious that they need my soul
p913
aVMy cousin's after Doe, like re-mi-fa-so
p914
aVI said, "Auntie, this is a safe career"\u000aShe said, "Drake, I told you there was no skatin' here"
p915
aV, but check
p916
aVSo now, it's me in old school checkered plaid
p917
aVAnd now I coast clear, take a deep breath
p918
aVFeeling like the Pope's here, homie, this is recess
p919
aVSo I kick, push
p920
aVKick, push
p921
aVCoast
p922
aVFast as the wheels replaced
p923
aVI gotta find another hobby just to fill the space
p924
aVPeep the way I roll
p925
aVJust a rebel, lookin' for a place to go
p926
aVSo I kick
p927
aVThen push
p928
aVAnd coast
p929
aVYou see the difference between me and you: is that I just hit rock bottom
p930
aVAfter this, I don't have a choice. I got people to provide for, promises I've made, and goals to meet. Hmm... what you got?
p931
aVComeback
p932
aVShake up the world, that is what I'm about to do
p933
aVAnd homie, you ain't even on my altitude
p934
aVI'm tellin you, I got enough clout for two
p935
aVAnd like a nigga turned Blood, I came out the blue
p936
aVThey like, "Damn who's Drake, where's wheelchair Jimmy at?"
p937
aVOn my Chris Brown shit, I'm still here, gimme that
p938
aVI'm cutting lights out like it's bedtime
p939
aVThese other rappers lukewarm like red wine
p940
aVThe truth hurts so please don't rub it in
p941
aVI'm not signed yet, so I'm still budgeting
p942
aVI'm like Jeopardy, I'm still buzzin in
p943
aVEvery city that you got a nephew or a cousin in
p944

aVCause you deal with agents from check collections
p963
aVI'm keepin' it cleaner than Little X direction
p964
aVAnd baby girl if you don't like me\u000aIt's probably due to the fact that you are a les like NextSelection

p3065
aVCause what I'm working with is timeless
p3066
aVAnd promoters try to get me out to they club\u000aThey say I have fun but I can't imagine how\u000aCause I just seen my ex-girl, standing with my next girl\u000aStanding with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now\u000aAnd shit could get weird unless they all down\u000aAnd so I stay clear,

p3072
aVAnd that's what happens\u000aWhen you spitting what's inside you
p3073
aVBut slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video\u000aAnd they think they can market you\u000aHowever they decide to nahh
p3074
aVBut 40 told me to do me
p3075
aVAnd don't listen to anybody that knew me\u000aCause to have known me would mean that there's a new me\u000aAnd if you think I changed in the slightest could've fooled me
p3076
aVBoy, in my city I'm da 2-3
p3077
aVI quit school and it's not because I'm lazy\u000aI'm just not the social type\u000aAnd campus life is crazy understand

p3089
aVBut how we move from A to B, it can't be up to me\u000aCause you don't know, who I was before you
p3090
aVAnd basically to see a change in me\u000aI'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah
p3091
aVOh, but you're on my mind\u000a(My mind, my mind, my mind, my mind)\u000aOh, but maybe in time (in time, in time, in time)\u000aI'll tell you I'm\u2014

aVLook, this is me, still the same
p3520
aVThey want the hits, I play the game
p3521
aVNo auto-tune,
p3522
aVbut you can feel the pain
p3523
aVIt all comes spilling out like I hit a vein
p3524
aVWhat up, Lil Bro?
p3525
aVWhat up, Slum Ville?
p3526
aVI hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still
p3527
aVThe fans thinking that we all signed for one mil
p3528
aVEqual opportunity rapping, that shit is unreal
p3529
aVThat ain't how it works,
p3530
aVthat ain't how it goes
p3531
aVAnd I been getting high just to balance out the lows
p3532
aVAnd I could use a writer just to balance out my flows\u000aBut I never share my thoughts, this is all a nigga knows
p3533
aVAnd every time I try, it opens up my eyes\u000aThese verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised
p3534
aVAnd I would be performing this as long as I'm alive
p3535
aVSo every word I utter will be mine
p3536
aVDon't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
p3537
aVPlease don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
p3538
aVI remember you, this feeling isn't new\u000aSo please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
p3539
aV(Don't take this the wrong way but, uh)\u000aI never cried when Pac died
p3540
aVBut I probably will when Hov does\u000aAnd if my tears hold value then I would drop one\u000aFor every single thing he showed us\u000aAnd I'll be standing in a puddle
p3541
aVI stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble
p3542
aVAnd I'mma keep it honest, I'm so tired of being subtle
p3543
aV40,
p3544
aVO,
p3545
aVNik
p3546
aVStaring at the members of my team
p3547
aVWho get questioned about they profit from this million dollar scheme\u000aJust know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams\u000aI hope you tell your families this shit ain't what it seems
p3548
aVBut y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion
p3549
aVYou know I spend money because spending time is hopeless
p3550
aVAnd know I pop bottles cause I bottle my emotions
p3551
aVAt least I put it all in the open
p3552
aVwe ignore feelings here
p3553
aVPremature millionaires,
p3554
aVYeah, I swear that we making a killing here
p3555
aVI should be on top of the world just chilling here
p3556
aVBut it's funny having fans\u000aWho find you before anybody ever has the chance\u000aAnd build you up, so you could be the biggest in the game\u000aAnd realize when you're there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same
p3557
aVYeah, and plus things are just surreal at home
p3558
aVPeople think I've changed just cause my appeal has grown
p3559
aVAnd now security follow me everywhere\u000aSo I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone
p3560
aVI think I'm scared of what the future holds
p3561
aVI was wishing for some things and now am used to those
p3562
aVEvery girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes\u000aThe honesty of my music has left me too exposed
p3563
aVAll my old friends think I got a new crowd
p3564
aVAnd people seem to notice every time I do smile\u000aI guess that mean they come few and far between\u000aEven know I'm living out what you would call the dream
p3565
aVAnd my uncle ain't even messaging me
p3566
aVAnd him missing in my life is kind of messing with me\u000aI hope this isn't one of those forever things
p3567
aVIt's funny how money can change everything
p3568
aVIt's just me,

p3808
aVThere was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it

p3812
aVMy dad called me up knowing that I still listen\u000aAnd he's still got his foot out, guilt tripping\u000aIt's been years though, I just learn to deal with it
p3813

p3833
aVI'm always up too late, I worry 'bout you there alone

p4291
aVYeah we want it all, half was never the agreement\u000aWho would have thought the route we'd chosen\u000aWould ever end up the scenic?
p4292
aVI can relate to kids going straight to the league\u000aWhen they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
p4293
aVAnd that's around the time\u000aThat your idols become your rivals\u000aYou make friends with Mike\u000aBut got to A.I. him for your survival

p4302
aVI think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women\u000aI think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me I'll miss it\u000aCause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
p4303
aVMan, the good girls went silent on me\u000aThey got a boyfriend, or left for college on me\u000aAnd all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now\u000aThat make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
p4304
aVBut do I ever come up in discussion\u000aOver double pump lattes and low fat muffins?
p4305
aVDo I? Or is missing what we had out of the question?\u000aI'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
p4306
aVI got flows for the Marilyn Monroes\u000aWho was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes
p4307
aVThey hear about your cons, but focus on your pros\u000aAnd love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
p4308
aVBut those same ones from your area will grow into women\u000aThat are ready to get married at hello
p4309
aVBecause of what they allowed,
p4310
aVwhere are they all now?\u000aI know they're somewhere watching\u000aSo I'm trying to make them proud
p4311
aVSearching for the meaning, you'll find it next to me
p4312
aVThey tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see
p4313
aVI'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?
p4314
aVThey say the doors will open up\u000aSoon as you find the missing key
p4315
aVThat's probably why I'm in this bitch shining
p4316
aVJump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
p4317
aVI rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
p4318
aVAnd the bandwagon's full\u000aBut you can try and run behind it, I'm sorry

aVShout out to my city though I hardly be in town
p4321
aVI'm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown
p4322
aVAnd I know life is just a game\u000aIn which the cards are facing down
p4323
aVI'm in a world where things are taken, never given
p4324
aVHow long they choose to love you will never be your decision\u000aAnd I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen\u000aSo while I'm still here in this position
p4325
aVThey say real girls ain't never perfect\u000aPerfect girls ain't real
p4326
aVEven though I like being in your past\u000aYou got a bright future behind you
p4327
aVGirl you crazy, sexy, cool

aVYou know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I\u2019m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days.
