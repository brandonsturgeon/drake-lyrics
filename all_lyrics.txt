aVThank you Ms. Graham for coming today. You look very nice today, sorry, that's not professional, I guess. They say in Canada, don't mingle business with pleasure, or something like that So, we have to talk about Aubrey, or how he likes to be called, Drake. As I always like to say, there is room for improvement in his learning from piano. He talks a lot, huh? He socialize when I'm teaching. Okay, and when it's time for him to play, he doesn't have pianist hands. If you need example: me, Mozart, and Ray Charles all of us have pianist hands. I'm the only one living with this hands, I guess. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding. Umm it seems like he likes the music and he obviously has a reason, but there is so much room for improvement, you know? Speaking of improvement, I don't think you, Ms. Graham need any of it. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding, haha

aVInstead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round
p5171
aVBut then Spring shows up, and it's Dallas in this bitch
p5172
aVThe weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
p5173
aVWhen we were together it seeming like way back when\u000aBall players hop on the plane and make it way back in\u000aSee she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa
p5174
aVInstead of saving for marriage, she saving for carrabanna
p5175
aVAnd it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime\u000aI guess, I lost another one to the wintertime
p5176
aV(give me a second to gather my thoughts)\u000aAnd watching winter turn to spring (Such a beautiful day man)\u000a(Yeah man, you know we had to switch it on 'em right?)\u000aStrolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing\u000a(I'm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss)\u000a(Man, but I got something to else to tell ya baby)
p5177
aVI remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up
p5178
aVNow Drake's committed we waiting on the breakup
p5179
aVSo we can get back to them cognac nights\u000aWith dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right\u000aAnd I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
p5180
aVThe winter came and blew his cold air through\u000aBack then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her\u000aBy the end of the week I would know that crew
p5181
aVAnd we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene\u000aWith three ladies in the shot we never broke routine\u000aAt the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin'
p5182
aVWe had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen
p5183
aVBut this Summer is different it's a two man operation\u000aGranted the fact that we one man short\u000aGot love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation\u000aCause handlin' crack is a one man sport
p5184
aVInstead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin'
p5185
aVI find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'\u000aThe face, the breast, the bras, the toes
p5186
aVI'm still solo and a long night draws to a close\u000aCause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside\u000aWe'll never talk again, scary and true
p5187
aVThat song Special I recorded with Voyce well it's like a classified\u000aIt's what I'm lookin for to carry me through
p5188
aVYet I can't seem to find it, every girl that possesses it
p5189
aVOnly wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit
p5190
aVAnd when they talk about they past and lovers\u000aAnd you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others
p5191
aVThere's also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive
p5192
aVStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring\u000aStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring\u000aStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring

p5282
aVYeah we want it all, half was never the agreement\u000aWho would have thought the route we'd chosen\u000aWould ever end up the scenic?
p5283
aVI can relate to kids going straight to the league\u000aWhen they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
p5284
aVAnd that's around the time\u000aThat your idols become your rivals\u000aYou make friends with Mike\u000aBut got to A.I. him for your survival

p5293
aVI think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women\u000aI think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me I'll miss it\u000aCause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
p5294
aVMan, the good girls went silent on me\u000aThey got a boyfriend, or left for college on me\u000aAnd all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now\u000aThat make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
p5295
aVBut do I ever come up in discussion\u000aOver double pump lattes and low fat muffins?
p5296
aVDo I? Or is missing what we had out of the question?\u000aI'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
p5297
aVI got flows for the Marilyn Monroes\u000aWho was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes
p5298
aVThey hear about your cons, but focus on your pros\u000aAnd love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
p5299
aVBut those same ones from your area will grow into women\u000aThat are ready to get married at hello
p5300
aVBecause of what they allowed,
p5301
aVwhere are they all now?\u000aI know they're somewhere watching\u000aSo I'm trying to make them proud

p5304
aVI'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?

p5519
aVYou took me places, you spent that\u000aThey said no, we went back\u000aChecks bounced but we bounced back\u000aI put all the money in your accounts back\u000aAnd I thank you, I don't know where\u000aI'd really be without that, it worked out\u000aMan, you deserve it

aVYou know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I\u2019m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days.

p6947
aVI empower girls that don't deserve it\u000aI don't mean to do that shit on purpose
p6948
aVIt's just that when I go home\u000aI start forgetting what it is\u000aThe dream is over, I get lost up in the 6
p6949
aVAnd you don't ever come to where I stay\u000aYou just rather stay up in your New York condo
p6950
aVYou don't ever come to where I stay\u000aIf anybody knows, girl you know, I know

p6953
aVLet me at least show you my side of things, man\u000aAw, man, aw, man, aw, man
p6954
aVSometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough\u000aTo feel what I'm about to say in this song
p6955
aVWhen they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself\u000aAnd you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
p6956
aVAnd they try to make you out as a lie
p6957
aVIt's ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason\u000aIt's a lose lose why even try
p6958
aVWhen your ideas so frequently get rejected
p6959
aVpeople just get neglected\u000aAnd they never really know how to feel
p6960
aVPhone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics\u000aAnd the motives to try and make them a mill
p6961
aVYou never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks
p6962
aVand\u000aNiggas wanna say that you ain't around
p6963
aVI mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming\u000aThat you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town
p6964
aVAnd the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin' is fresher\u000aThan most of these rappers running the game
p6965
aVCertain people will copy what's in the past to turn the profit with cash\u000aThere's time I would have done it the same
p6966
aVI mean I got me a Range, Also got me a guilty conscience\u000aThat made you tell anybody I meet that I rent
p6967
aVSometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers\u000aAnd watched the game from the bleachers
p6968
aVBecause I'm really tend to need what I spent
p6969
aVIn a house that I promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time\u000aI wasted out late at the club
p6970
aVInstead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I'm working hard on the winter\u000aSo this album is a labor of love
p6971
aVYou say as long as I'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats\u000aThat she can rest without a toss and a turn
p6972
aVBecause she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on TV\u000aThat's exactly why I often get burned
p6973
aVThat there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping
p6974
aVChorus: (x4)
p6975
aVYou gonna try to try harder cuz
p6976
aVTry harder cuz
p6977
aVTry Try-Try-Try
p6978
aVBut I'm gonna try to..
p6979
aVYeah, 9th Wonder!
p6980
aVClaim we're early and be showing up extra late
p6981
aVThey don't be saying how I'm humble, I'm hella nice\u000aOr that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice
p6982
aVThey just tell you all the rumors they heard\u000aAnd we laugh soon as you come and tell me like Amel and Bryce\u000aMy groove theory
p6983
aVThat's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
p6984
aVAnd if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it
p6985
aVBut I hate it when they judge me on how I sound\u000aI mean I spit that influential shit from my town
p6986
aVYou probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and\u000aSwang dick to these hoes like nunchucks\u000aWell, you can think what you want but\u000aI think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut
p6987
aVYou need to get real and check out my real life\u000aI ain't a tip-drill, don't care what it smell like\u000aBut if you feel like putting all your notions aside\u000aAnd talking to a real nigga, I'd gladly oblige
p6988
aVFirst name Phonte, I'd be pleased to date ya\u000aCollege educated, got degrees in papers
p6989
aVMaybe with me you'll unlearn\u000aPutting all niggas in a box of concerns
p6990
aVThey say you never judge a book by its cover\u000aThough you appear as materialistic, just like the others
p6991
aVSo I followed your words to take 'em in\u000aAnd I don't see what you saying so they coming off paper thin\u000aThat's when I felt that I would need to\u000aDo more than just look you up and down to see if I could read you
p6992
aVYou only out for the paperback that's written all over your face\u000aNo El' will never judge a book by its cover
p6993
aVDon't judge me man
p6994
aVThey tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
p6995
aVThey say we lack substance
p6996
aVMe, 'Te and El' bout to prove 'em wrong though
p6997
aVUh, we know what you're thinking love
p6998
aVYou think we out smoking and drinking love
p6999
aVPushing big whips, chains clinking love
p7000
aVBut y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
p7001
aVWe know how you speculate
p7002
aVThinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
p7003
aV, love
p7004
aVis that when you too cheery
p7005
aVThey try to bring you down to the level they at
p7006
aVWell when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
p7007
aVBut, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart girl
p7008
aVNah, they probably think I'll break your heart girl
p7009
aVHaha, I can't lie, you probably right about it
p7010
aVI don't know why you sitting on the couch
p7011
aVWhen you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
p7012
aVYou think taking your purse off
p7013
aVWill lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
p7014
aVAt least I got status because I could've been a local emcee
p7015
aVAnd you probably would've been worse off
p7016
aVSo I'mma take this hat off, and I'mma hit it till I'm back soft
p7017
aVAnd then I backs off
p7018
aVCause you thinking you can predict what happen
p7019
aVYou the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping
p7020
aVBut I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping
p7021
aVOr rapping bout trapping you's a freak of nature
p7022
aVSuch an anomaly, speak so well
p7023
aVAnd talk so collegy, such an astonishing
p7024
aVContrast to all the bullshit you've been following
p7025
aVOn behalf of them, I offer my apologies
p7026
aVMe, cause I ain't dumb, shit I'm well read like sunburn
p7027
aVAnd after me you'll never leave no stone unturned
p7028
aVAnd try to get inside your head only
p7029
aVNot just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me
p7030
aVSo what I learned on my path to discover?
p7031
aVYour story took one ugly turn after another
p7032
aVI saw we wasn't on the same page
p7033
aVI would've gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way
p7034
aVSo now I'm closing the case

p7039
aVI just hit Alt, Tab\u000aSwitchin' in between two convos

p7041
aVYeah, normally it ain't a question\u000aWe would cross paths like an intersection\u000aBut she just too far away for affection\u000aSo I pray that we never lose a connection
p7042
aVCause I remember Stacy, she prolly hate me\u000aShe used to threaten she had a man to replace me\u000aShe talk that shit, I just hit the escape key\u000aAnd then she get mad and wanna go and erase me
p7043

p7045
aVShe said I'm too wild, she wanna tame me\u000aI told her even Photoshop couldn't change me

aVI hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don\u2019t I?\u000aI get off topic don\u2019t I? I get it poppin\u2019 don\u2019t I?\u000aI\u2019ll end up stopping won\u2019t I? And by the time I end up stopping\u000aYou\u2019ll be rocking one of the rings you pointed out while shopping with a nigga don\u2019t lie
p7090
aVShe\u2019s losing it right now,
p7091
aVcause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been moving in by now
p7092
aVBut instead we're moving slow -- I guess she's used to it by now
p7093
aVAnd she gives me all her trust and I'm abusing it right now
p7094
aVBut this money coming in is just confusing shit right now
p7095
aVYou just told me I ain't shit and I guess I'm proving it right now
p7096
aVI'd rather be with you, but you are not around\u000aSo I'mma call somebody up and see if they be down\u000aCause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
p7097
aVHalf the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing\u000aYou leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months\u000aBut I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
p7098
aVSo she\u2019s here and we're both so gone
p7099
aVHotel to hotel, girl - I could use your company\u000aFull name and birthday, I book a flight, you come to me
p7100
aVBut she don't want a weekend - she wants all of me or none of me
p7101
aVIf she can't work with all of me then she say she done with me
p7102
aVYou say that you over me you always end up under me\u000aYou know how it goes - don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me\u000aDon't start with yo shit - I put you back in your place
p7103
aVShe tells me "I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face"
p7104
aVAnd hang up yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you\u000aLike I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with, too
p7105
aVAnd whoever I be with, they got nothing on you\u000aThat's just something to do when there's nothing to do
p7106
aVYeah, but she's losing it right now
p7107
aVShe has choices she should make I think she's choosing it right now\u000aOne more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
p7108
aVYou just said I never learn I guess I'm proving it right now
p7109
aVOoh, baby, yeah
p7110
aVDays in the sun\u000aAnd nights in the rain
p7111
aVSummer is over, simple and plain
p7112
aVFound me some fun that's good for the pain\u000aAlready told you, I don't feel the same\u000aI don't feel the same
p7113
aVAnywhere I go\u000aI can't help but show\u000aI don't feel the same\u000aAnywhere I go\u000aI can't help but know\u000aI don't feel the same\u000aAnywhere I go\u000aI can't help but know
p7114
aVWhat up, Lupe?\u000aChi-Town, check
p7115
aVMy style is very Tennessee mixed with some Terry Kennedy
p7116
aVPeople barely remember me from back in the day
p7117
aVI done got some contacts and threw the glasses away\u000aThe time it took me to get cool was a massive delay
p7118
aVIt gets boring growing up in Memphis\u000aTryna become a pro, but keep showing up apprentice
p7119
aVMama probably would've done anything to prevent this\u000aCause every single time I break a board, it gets expensive
p7120
aVLuckily, my aunt workin' as a nurse\u000aSo every time I needed something, she just reach up in her purse
p7121
aVAnd plus, she'd always give me speeches on the first\u000aIf I'm stayin' in her house, then I need to get some work
p7122
aVI tell her I was there on vacation\u000aShe said, "You need to be doing something other than skatin'
p7123
aVWhy don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement?\u000aI'mma let him know that you comin', honey, he's waitin'"
p7124
aVPlaying chess, looking through some old school record ads
p7125
aVHe knew I didn't really wanna post here\u000aOpened up the window and told me that the coast clear
p7126
aVThis is each test life's ever given me\u000aA-plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
p7127
aVYes, I'm literally Larnell Lewis with a\u000aKick and a snare, a kickflip in the air
p7128
aVThe kid's sick denim jeans, put a rip in a pair\u000aJust so the space ain't restricted in here, breathe again
p7129
aVThink it's obvious that they need my soul
p7130
aVMy cousin's after Doe, like re-mi-fa-so
p7131
aVI said, "Auntie, this is a safe career"\u000aShe said, "Drake, I told you there was no skatin' here"
p7132
aV, but check
p7133
aVSo now, it's me in old school checkered plaid
p7134
aVAnd now I coast clear, take a deep breath
p7135
aVFeeling like the Pope's here, homie, this is recess
p7136
