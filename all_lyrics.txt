aVThank you Ms. Graham for coming today. You look very nice today, sorry, that's not professional, I guess. They say in Canada, don't mingle business with pleasure, or something like that So, we have to talk about Aubrey, or how he likes to be called, Drake. As I always like to say, there is room for improvement in his learning from piano. He talks a lot, huh? He socialize when I'm teaching. Okay, and when it's time for him to play, he doesn't have pianist hands. If you need example: me, Mozart, and Ray Charles all of us have pianist hands. I'm the only one living with this hands, I guess. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding. Umm it seems like he likes the music and he obviously has a reason, but there is so much room for improvement, you know? Speaking of improvement, I don't think you, Ms. Graham need any of it. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding, haha

aVGet the info, leave with ya money man, thats how the world is
p384
aVThats how niggas puttin they dirt down
p385
aVStreets are seedy, I call em sesame
p386
aVIt's Ernie and Bert's town
p387
aV'specially when these young'ns get turned down for work opportunities
p388
aVNext week same place'll get burnt down
p389
aVCoincidink? not likely not a chance
p390
aVHow can we be so aware of these problems and not advance?
p391
aVAt least start put a bid in, its hard just to fit in
p392
aVA lot of people only play they part when they spittin
p393
aVBut I don't think that they understood
p394
aVThey using this darkness for penetration in the hood
p395
aVI took the ivory way in and yes I'm glad that keenan could
p396
aVNot bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good
p397
aVLove's lost
p398
aVLove's gone
p399
aVLove lost
p400
aVLove is gone
p401
aVLook
p402
aVIn this world of desperate housewives and freakin players
p403
aVRappers they tend to be smilin'
p404
aVBecause they swimmin' in women
p405
aVMost of em seeking favors
p406
aVThey come in secret flavors
p407
aVThat's why I envy Omar
p408
aVBecause so far I'm nowhere close to Malik and Deja
p409
aVAnd that's some higher learning
p410
aVTrying to excel with the brake on
p411
aVI'll have you stuck in the same spot
p412
aVWith the tires burnin'
p413
aVAnd I'm a liar turnin' 19, jaded with no faith
p414
aVIn any female that's askin what I was earnin
p415
aVI met this recent lady
p416
aVShe knew a piece of sadey by spinners
p417
aVI guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe
p418
aVWell second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby
p419
aVCause she ain't give me the butterflies that Aleshia gave me
p420
aVIt's like I'm using some bread to sop up some decent gravy
p421
aVNow I'm out of both and I've been thinkin' of Aleshia lately
p422
aVI'm all alone, I got a feelin it's on
p423
aVCause nowadays most of the thrill of chillin' is gone and uh
p424
aVSome dudes they turn purple with hurt faces
p425
aVCircling workplaces
p426
aVAnd following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is
p427
aVThey get to first bases
p428
aVThen they get to retreating cause if she cheatin'
p429
aVHe wanna know what the first trace is
p430
aVNow you like Macgyver
p431
aVCause you sneakin' around
p432
aVAnd she don't know that you there when you standin' right beside her
p433
aVI can relate to that
p434
aVI had to take it back a couple a years
p435
aVWhen some of the best kicked it with Drake in fact
p436
aVI bet that they knew it cause in my mind I play through it with
p437
aVAnd in the end I listen but I don't see me as they do
p438
aVCause it's my opinion, my life, my potentials for my wife
p439
aVAnd I used to be eager to buy em the world
p440
aVMaybe I'm confused about what I desire from girls
p441
aVEither way I'm all alone, got a feelin' it's on
p442
aVCause nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin' is gone and uh
p443
aVCheck
p444
aVAnd nowadays some girls are the type of person that
p445
aVWill tell they friends that they use him which is confusing
p446
aVSince I ain't made them a purchase yet
p447
aVBut there's logic behind it
p448
aVEmotions double and they try to cover up
p449
aVLike a mansion with the projects behind it
p450
aVI tend to freak with this
p451
aVI get a girl and pretend that I love the spending
p452
aVAnd all she gave was a decent kiss
p453
aVThinking she been spoiled
p454
aVBut golddiggin' is nothing when you can shovel for days
p455
aVAnd come up with tin foil
p456
aVWe could dissect it see
p457
aVYou take a Dominique or another freak in the sheets
p458
aVAnd you picture that she just slept with me for nothing
p459
aVGave her nothing
p460
aVHer reputation's in jeopardy
p461
aVCause it ain't take a spree of that shopping to get her next to me
p462
aVCollectively I look for a proper chick that'll rep for me
p463
aVInstead of seeing something she wants and calling and texting me
p464
aVFor thinking that exists, I got a feeling I'm wrong
p465
aVNowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh
p466
aVLook, if you a girl with the aspirations
p467
aVOf being in the background witcha asses shakin
p468
aVHittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin
p469
aVI ask you to have some patience
p470
aV(you're worth so much more)
p471
aVTo my dudes at the bar with a freak and
p472
aVSteady lightin cigars at the parties they sneak in
p473
aVAnd look forward to being a star on the weekend
p474
aVYa are part of the speech coz
p475
aVI'm from the city where people be gettin lazy
p476
aVLitterin in the streets
p477
aVAnd the club district is poppin like literally every week
p478
aVAnd promoters'll push flyers
p479
aVMoney exchange hands
p480
aVLiars sell you they dreams
p481
aVAnd dummies exchange plans
p482
aVHustlers give you events
p483
aVBouncers give you pass
p484
aVDirectors give em a shot
p485
aVSo girls'll give up the ass
p486
aVAnd groupies that would flock to hometown athletes
p487
aVAnd start rolling together like snoopy and woodstock
p488
aVDaffy and bugs, its all laughing and hugs
p489
aVTil the dude catch a plane
p490
aVAnd she back where she was
p491
aVRight back on the bus
p492
aVIts a shame cause now at his window
p493
aVShe throwin bricks like shaq in the clutch
p494
aVYou can see thats shes colder
p495
aVCuz he doesnt hold her
p496
aVFall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder
p497
aVKnow that he tried ta told her
p498
aVThat he couldn't mold her
p499
aVIf this the type of chick you wanna be when you older, I say
p500
aVNow up north theres five artists deservin a listen
p501
aVAnd I'm one of em, the other four you know who you are
p502
aVBut if you gotta think through
p503
aVChances are that it ain't you
p504
aVI singlehandedly carry out what you can't do
p505
aVAnd see I take a couple of breathers
p506
aVAnd then things come together on the spot like a couple thats eager
p507
aVIf you wanna pack a duffel and leave her
p508
aVGo ahead, I couldn't give two damns like a couple of beavers
p509
aVWhenever I'm out in memphis the man seen as trill
p510
aVAnd every verse the man seem to kill
p511
aVYou can find him with black jays and socks like I'm andreena mill
p512
aVJapan and brazil, the audience acreaming
p513
aVAnd then you come around and all the fans seems to chill
p514
aVAdvances to deals, financing appeals
p515
aVThe hustles, I have you feeling like you dancing in heels and uh
p516
aVIf you a girl with the aspirations
p517
aVTo my dudes in the bar with a freak and
p518
aVSteady lightin cigars in the parties they sneak in
p519
aVUh, yea, get in my Slick Rick mode

p523
aVEven if the house was ten grand
p524
aVAnd there was no pool
p525
aVWould I still be without my swim fan?
p526
aVThe ceiling could be higher
p527
aVShe making requests
p528
aVDon't know if she feeling me or she be feelin what I buy her
p529
aVAnd purses are light now
p530
aVShe use 'em all the time
p531
aVSo she smilin to the the point that it hurt when she bite down
p532
aVAnd she simply a new model
p533
aVStay spendin dollars
p534
aVBut she got less sense than a empty perfume bottle
p535
aVAt times she a solid chick
p536
aVAnd I'm a sucka for the cuties
p537
aVSo she always lookin good when my wallet's thick
p538
aVChillin on the linen, she all up in the closet so much
p539
aVGot a hunch thats shes feelin other women
p540
aVWant the diamonds on the face in the center
p541
aVNice guys finish last so I'm winnin every race that I enter and she a
p542
aVVideo girl
p543
aVEh yo you have to listen

aVI'm in a bad position
p545
aVI fell in love with a...
p546
aVI wouldn't call her name

aVI got the feelin that they all the same
p548
aVAnd she a
p549
aVTo the fullest extent
p550
aVSo I wrote you a song
p551
aVCuz I can't stay with a

aVMy old girl would say
p555
aVLook at Vida Guerrera
p556
aVThere's no need to compare her
p557
aVI bet she smiles cuz she loves what she sees in the mirror
p558
aVI bet she's out meetin' directors instead
p559
aVAnd frustrated cause shes already been undressed in they head
p560
aVBe a teacher, open up shop if you can do nails fine
p561
aVApply for a business loan and I'll bet you that they'll sign
p562
aVIf you a real dime
p563
aVPoppin as if its your only option
p564
aVGirl there's things to do
p565
aVOther than jail time

aVLook this ain't a song dissing half of these rappers
p567
aVOr pasha and sasha, esther baxter
p568
aVMelyssa ford, or katy or anyone after
p569
aVI just give my opinion for laughter
p570
aVOr maybe to think on
p571
aVSo next time you out at the club
p572
aVAnd a brother offers the whole table something to drink on
p573
aVYou just take in fact he got a stack with a mink on

aVAnd he ask questions later and pat down first
p581
aVBut you ain't thandie newton, and this ain't crash here
p582
aVThe resolutions passed baby, this ain't last year
p583
aVLook, I got a message, I'll say it
p584
aVI got some beats still
p585
aVRegina Hall and Garcelle and Elise Neal
p586
aVYoung girls these here women with big dreams
p587
aVRole models that you can watch on the big screen

aVRespect yourself, don't be convinced that these tricks will
p590
aVYou got an audience believe it or not
p591
aVMy cousin who can't speak know the lyrics to tip drill
p592
aVI fell in love with a
p593
aVAnd I ain't trying ta generalize every video girl, you n'a mean?
p594
aVSay that ya all one way man its just that sometimes man you gotta
p595
aVAccept the fact that there's times that you gotta better yourself
p596
aVYou know as a person man. I love to see my black women strong, single
p597
aVIndependent. doing they thing without popping they booty in some rappers
p598

aVThis one ladies. just take my advice you n'a mean? cuz its like uh
p600
aVAnd she beautiful and honey dances

aVAnd anything the color of braces she get excited
p603
aVShe always showing up at these places she get invited
p604
aVShe a video girl
p605
aVYeah, this dedicated to Canada man
p606
aVThe whole up North
p607
aVA lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the Winter
p608
aVBut listen
p609
aVI met this new girl late June or early July
p610
aVI called her a bunch of times but she barely replied
p611
aVNow it's December, I'm driving, and she's like "Where's my hi?"
p612
aVIt's weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy
p613
aVSee that was a segue, I believe the matter
p614
aVIs what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter
p615
aVWhere the Timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up
p616
aVDrug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up
p617
aVWhere girls become exes from Summer's caught ho'in
p618
aVThe winter cars come out, the summer cars go in
p619
aVAnd some places is breezy, and some it start snow-ing
p620
aVAnd if you planning family vacations you better know when
p621
aVBut some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city
p622
aVInstead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity
p623
aVCause mom stays up late, she seen them videos
p624
aVWhere Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!
p625
aVYeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man
p626
aVA lot of girls y'know, wanna get close. you might think they the one
p627
aVBut just wait, nah mean, take it slow
p628
aVForget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach
p629
aVShe lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet
p630
aVSince I'm driving, I ask her how to get to the suite
p631
aVShe doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat
p632
aVShe throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat
p633
aVShe's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet
p634
aVThen she says "I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat
p635
aVI mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat
p636
aVI love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good
p637
aVThere's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat"
p638
aVOff this I'm kinda takin it back for a second
p639
aVI get her number she tells me to call her after this session
p640
aVAnd so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch
p641
aVUntil we end up sexin' and now my heart attached
p642
aVI'm thinkin off I should've been more Southern
p643
aVAnd realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho!
p644
aVYeah, uh, I told ya'll I had a story for you right
p645
aVUh, ya man, it's what it is
p646
aVAnd now, I'm proud to have her like Montreal to the frizzench
p647
aVShe love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench
p648
aVBut, my boy say I'm actin different, because I lay downtown
p649
aVAnd I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench
p650
aVShe tellin everyone I'mma hold here down
p651
aVTell everyone I'm the prince up in this cold clear town
p652
aVAnd stupid me I just listen to her
p653
aVInstead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round
p654
aVBut then Spring shows up, and it's Dallas in this bitch
p655
aVThe weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
p656
aVWhen we were together it seeming like way back when
p657
aVBall players hop on the plane and make it way back in
p658
aVSee she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa
p659
aVInstead of saving for marriage, she saving for carrabanna
p660
aVAnd it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime
p661
aVI guess, I lost another one to the wintertime
p662
aV(give me a second to gather my thoughts)
p663
aVAnd watching winter turn to spring (Such a beautiful day man)
p664
aV(Yeah man, you know we had to switch it on 'em right?)
p665
aVStrolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing
p666
aV(I'm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss)
p667
aV(Man, but I got something to else to tell ya baby)
p668
aVI remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up
p669
aVNow Drake's committed we waiting on the breakup
p670
aVSo we can get back to them cognac nights
p671
aVWith dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right
p672
aVAnd I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
p673
aVThe winter came and blew his cold air through
p674
aVBack then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her
p675
aVBy the end of the week I would know that crew
p676
aVAnd we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene
p677
aVWith three ladies in the shot we never broke routine
p678
aVAt the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin'
p679
aVWe had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen
p680
aVBut this Summer is different it's a two man operation
p681
aVGranted the fact that we one man short
p682
aVGot love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation
p683
aVCause handlin' crack is a one man sport
p684
aVInstead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin'
p685
aVI find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'
p686
aVThe face, the breast, the bras, the toes
p687
aVI'm still solo and a long night draws to a close
p688
aVCause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside
p689
aVWe'll never talk again, scary and true
p690
aVThat song Special I recorded with Voyce well it's like a classified
p691
aVIt's what I'm lookin for to carry me through
p692
aVYet I can't seem to find it, every girl that possesses it
p693
aVOnly wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit
p694
aVAnd when they talk about they past and lovers
p695
aVAnd you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others
p696
aVYet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride
p697
aVThere's also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive
p698
aVStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring
p699
aVYeah. Ho!
p700
aVIt's Drake. Uh Uh. Ho!
p701
aVDo that dance. Do that Dance
p702
aVYou special girl, don't leave me baby
p703
aVTo find another just like you won't be easy baby
p704
aVSo, at least I know where the ones at
p705
aVBaby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
p706
aVLook I ought to be thankful with women I have plenty of luck
p707
aVAnd when it comes to relationships, many is stuck
p708
aVLook at fifty you make love, thirty you have sex
p709
aVSomewhere around the tender age of twenty you fuck
p710
aVOr maybe before, I'm here waiting to score
p711
aVIt's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car
p712
aVInstead these girls taking it raw
p713
aVNow they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore
p714
aVForget, wait till it's right, now it's wait till it's more
p715
aVWait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour
p716
aVSo they dance to attract me, advance and attack me
p717
aVTo the point that Drake compare me to Anthony Mackie
p718
aVBut once they have my pants and my khakis
p719
aVI tell them I'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly
p720
aVBecause, I hate waking up undressed with a dame
p721
aVAnd guessing her name, I hope this shit is destined to change
p722
aVI don't get it, it's like my fairy was sick
p723
aVIt's like I meet the perfect girl, and she put me through some various shit
p724
aVIt's something that I can rarely predict
p725
aVAll I know is that I can never find the love that Tyler Perry depict
p726
aVI'm guessing maybe Shemar Moore isn't really all pure
p727
aVMaybe I lie to myself and it's like a small cure
p728
aVI tell it all to her
p729
aVI gotta feeling this feeling inside is something it's like and can't be all sure
p730
aVBecause really, What is a window without a car door?
p731
aVWhy I can't settle for one instead of all four?
p732
aVMu mind is clouded, this shit complex here
p733
aVJason tell me I'mma have a baby by next year
p734
aVPsychic told me I'mma have three kids
p735
aVI don't want my daughter making a song like Teairra Mari did
p736

aVI made money thats why these girls eyeing me down
p752
aVBy nineteen I might seem destined for millions
p753
aVPromoters on my ass so I'm guessing they filled in
p754
aVI take cues from my big boy Popz
p755
aVI'm the only young dude that the big boys watch
p756
aVThey getting foul on the star
p757

aVThey need a second plate a this knowledge
p770
aVIf you ain't got it you could catch it later
p771
aVMy money and love is separate before I commit to date her
p772
aVI put a split in the middle and learn to separate her
p773
aVIt ain't about the rims on my truck
p774
aVAin't about the ice on my watch
p775
aVAin't about the coupe or my truck
p776
aVBaby it's about the game
p777
aVRidin' low
p778
aVLayed back in the seat when I creep
p779
aVThat's just how I roll
p780
aVWith some fresh nice ones on my feet
p781
aVGirl that's how it goes
p782
aVAnd I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't 'bout the dough
p783
aVCause it ain't all about that no more
p784

p877
aVSince they don't show me sincerity, I load up, lock up

p879
aVAnd compared to D
p880
aVThey one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me
p881
aVIf that's not how it is it's how it appear to be
p882
aVYou got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader
p883
aVAnd when the psychic get to touching my palm
p884
aVSeein' your physical, the things that you never say to me visible
p885
aVEspecially when one of your artists feeling threatened
p886
aVCause I'm harnessing a weapon, won't you pardon my reflection
p887
aVMirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
p888
aVAnd play around, to perfection I'm the spitting image
p889
aVMy verbal camp is vivid, I told you I'm spitting image
p890
aVIt seems we often want to start but never get to finish
p891
aVMy verbal campus is Villanova, and those of you feelin Hova
p892
aVAnd writing college rhymes, but the thrill is over
p893
aVLet me assist you like a specialist
p894
aVSo you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
p895
aVIt's not a problem wit X, I guess I'm a pessimist
p896
aVWhich means if shit goes bad I say, "I expected this"
p897
aVAnd me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate
p898
aVInstead of understanding its a tune of hate
p899
aVThe city's mine like Oklahoma's a Sooner state
p900
aVAnd we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
p901
aVSo, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut
p902
aVYou ain't Morris Chestnut, you lighter and less cut
p903
aVAnd lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar
p904
aVYou still a protege, that's the reason I don't holler
p905
aVYou got rappers being repetitive actors
p906
aVYou stay ahead of the game, I'm ahead of the practice boy
p907
aVYeah, Ren, M.O.F, Haha
p908
aVIt's Drake man, it's Drake man.Yeah
p909
aVAyo Ren this that gritty shit here man
p910
aVI'ma have to tell them about I been through on this know what I mean
p911
aVHO! Southern Smoke!!!
p912
aVVery few give you that truth, it's either they can't do it with lyrics
p913
aVOr can't do it in spirit, they cancel what they doin'
p914
aVThe samples that they usin', can't get through the clearin'
p915
aVI'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it
p916
aVMy father's early careerin' forced my parents to split up
p917
aVMy mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up
p918
aVWith just being a florist, so the choir sang his chorus
p919
aVAnd he got back into doin' what he was doing before us
p920
aVBecause money is an issue, your son, he gon' miss you
p921
aVAnd plus you got a wife at home cause mommy still exist too
p922
aVNow you lookin' for exes, you ain't never expect this
p923
aVYou end up doing time, and me, I end up with a step-sis
p924
aVNobody passing judgment, they question where the drugs went
p925
aVYou know I hold you down because without you, I'd be a wasn't
p926
aVAnd mommy I'mma support her, I keep it all in order
p927
aVSee her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border
p928
aVBut
p929
aVI got stress on my shoulders
p930
aVTrying to keep my heart pure but this world is makin' it colder
p931
aVYoung black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
p932
aVAnd you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
p933
aVIT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!
p934
aVI'm just tryna live my life cuz
p935
aVMake a little money, find a bunny
p936
aVTo make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
p937
aVI'm just trying to live my life cuz
p938
aVThis is my life, and so the rest has kinda been cool
p939
aVQuestion what I been through
p940
aVI write a verse addressin' it
p941
aVAnd yes I might offend you
p942
aVPicture when I was in school
p943
aVMe being the closest thing to black
p944
aVAnd guess what rap music what I was into
p945
aVRest of the kids were sheltered
p946
aVI never liked to fight
p947
aVBut when someone called me a "nigga"
p948
aVI'd punch em I couldn't help it
p949
aVNow I'm grown I can say what it is
p950
aVIt's parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raisin' they kids
p951
aVAnd your daddy want it very right
p952
aVI make you happy, plus I'm Jewish, he don't approve
p953
aVI think he want you to marry white
p954
aVHe want Sinatra at the wedding, not Barry White
p955
aVCause black is black honey, even if he's very light
p956
aVAnd so I never been for dinner at they places
p957
aVAlways brutally honest, and so I pin it to they faces
p958
aVI live it so the case is, whether Drake is
p959
aVWay ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist
p960
aVAm I hot as the rest? should I strive for my spot as the best?
p961
aVLike girls with Double D's, I got a lot on my chest
p962
aVThere's questions that need to be answered that's not on the test
p963
aVInstead of starin' at quizzes now it's models with breasts
p964
aVAnd yes, when I'm dismissed after a tedious listen
p965
aVI sit at home and say I should of been a pediatrician
p966
aVHomie, I probably could've been on TV consistent
p967
aVAn artist like Pablo, maybe Petey's assistant
p968
aVAnd my mindset is come and get me
p969
aVI'm all alone at home with my mom and grandma and ain't nobody runnin' with me
p970
aVSo, if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady
p971
aVDaughter, and her grandson, nigga get the handgun
p972
aVIf not, you gon make me call the burbs out in Richmond
p973
aVThat have you niggas laying out on the curb, they some hitmen
p974
aVLast couple of months I done probably been around the world and back
p975
aVAnd I don't wanna question half the places Nick been
p976
aVSometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough
p977
aVTo feel what I'm about to say in this song
p978
aVWhen they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself
p979
aVAnd you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
p980
aVThat there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping
p981
aVAnd they try to make you out as a lie
p982
aVIt's ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason
p983
aVIt's a lose lose why even try
p984
aVWhen your ideas so frequently get rejected, people just get neglected
p985
aVAnd they never really know how to feel
p986
aVPhone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics
p987
aVAnd the motives to try and make them a mill
p988
aVYou never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and
p989
aVNiggas wanna say that you ain't around
p990
aVI mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming
p991
aVThat you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town
p992
aVChorus: (x4)
p993
aVYou gonna try to try harder cuz
p994
aVTry harder cuz
p995
aVTry Try-Try-Try
p996
aVAnd the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin' is fresher
p997
aVThan most of these rappers running the game
p998
aVCertain people will copy what's in the past to turn the profit with cash
p999
aVThere's time I would have done it the same
p1000
aVI mean I got me a Range, Also got me a guilty conscience
p1001
aVThat made you tell anybody I meet that I rent
p1002
aVSometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers
p1003
aVAnd watched the game from the bleachers
p1004
aVBecause I'm really tend to need what I spent
p1005
aVIn a house that I promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time
p1006
aVI wasted out late at the club
p1007
aVInstead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I'm working hard on the winter
p1008
aVSo this album is a labor of love
p1009
aVYou say as long as I'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats
p1010
aVThat she can rest without a toss and a turn
p1011
aVBecause she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on TV
p1012
aVThat's exactly why I often get burned
p1013
aVBut I'm gonna try to..
p1014
aVWhat up, Lupe?
p1015
aVChi-Town, check
p1016
aVMy style is very Tennessee mixed with some Terry Kennedy
p1017
aVPeople barely remember me from back in the day
p1018
aVI done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
p1019
aVThe time it took me to get cool was a massive delay, but check
p1020
aVIt gets boring growing up in Memphis
p1021
aVTryna become a pro, but keep showing up apprentice
p1022
aVMama probably would've done anything to prevent this
p1023
aVCause every single time I break a board, it gets expensive
p1024
aVLuckily, my aunt workin' as a nurse
p1025
aVSo every time I needed something, she just reach up in her purse
p1026
aVAnd plus, she'd always give me speeches on the first
p1027
aVIf I'm stayin' in her house, then I need to get some work
p1028
aVI tell her I was there on vacation
p1029
aVShe said, "You need to be doing something other than skatin'
p1030
aVWhy don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement?
p1031
aVI'mma let him know that you comin', honey, he's waitin'"
p1032
aVSo now, it's me in old school checkered plaid
p1033
aVPlaying chess, looking through some old school record ads
p1034
aVHe knew I didn't really wanna post here
p1035
aVOpened up the window and told me that the coast clear
p1036
aVAnd now I coast clear, take a deep breath
p1037
aVFeeling like the Pope's here, homie, this is recess
p1038
aVThis is each test life's ever given me
p1039
aVA-plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
p1040
aVYes, I'm literally Larnell Lewis with a
p1041
aVKick and a snare, a kickflip in the air
p1042
aVThe kid's sick denim jeans, put a rip in a pair
p1043
aVJust so the space ain't restricted in here, breathe again
p1044
aVThink it's obvious that they need my soul
p1045
aVMy cousin's after Doe, like re-mi-fa-so
p1046
aVI said, "Auntie, this is a safe career"
p1047
aVShe said, "Drake, I told you there was no skatin' here"
p1048
aVSo I kick, push
p1049
aVKick, push
p1050
aVCoast
p1051
aVFast as the wheels replaced
p1052
aVI gotta find another hobby just to fill the space
p1053
aVPeep the way I roll
p1054
aVJust a rebel, lookin' for a place to go
p1055
aVSo I kick
p1056
aVThen push
p1057
aVAnd coast
p1058
aVYou see the difference between me and you: is that I just hit rock bottom
p1059
aVAfter this, I don't have a choice. I got people to provide for, promises I've made, and goals to meet. Hmm... what you got?
p1060
aVComeback
p1061
aVShake up the world, that is what I'm about to do
p1062
aVAnd homie, you ain't even on my altitude
p1063
aVI'm tellin you, I got enough clout for two
p1064
aVAnd like a nigga turned Blood, I came out the blue
p1065
aVThey like, "Damn who's Drake, where's wheelchair Jimmy at?"
p1066
aVOn my Chris Brown shit, I'm still here, gimme that
p1067
aVI'm cutting lights out like it's bedtime
p1068
aVThese other rappers lukewarm like red wine
p1069
aVThe truth hurts so please don't rub it in
p1070
aVI'm not signed yet, so I'm still budgeting
p1071
aVI'm like Jeopardy, I'm still buzzin in
p1072
aVEvery city that you got a nephew or a cousin in
p1073
aVI miss cake these days
p1074
aVI can't even afford a mistake these days
p1075
aVAll of my favorite girls miss Drake these days
p1076
aVPlease don't take offense to my ways
p1077
aVCause I need drug money
p1078
aVWho got drug money?
p1079
aVI am talkin "white Phantom sittin' on dub" money
p1080
aVI am talkin "cold champagne at the club" money

p1083
aVWhy you gotta act dumb?
p1084

aVHope you enjoy your stay, drinks are on me by the way
p1092

aVHow the fuck Jay and Dame gon' break up before they meet Drake?
p1094
aVI'm sure it can be resolved, I'm just hopin that they make up
p1095
aVI'm perfecting my craft using more Sess

p1102
aVI'm keepin' it cleaner than Little X direction
p1103
aVAnd baby girl if you don't like me

p2059
aVYeah, 9th Wonder! Don't judge me man
p2060
aVThey tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
p2061
aVThey say we lack substance
p2062
aVMe, 'Te and El' bout to prove 'em wrong though
p2063
aVUh, we know what you're thinking love
p2064
aVYou think we out smoking and drinking love
p2065
aVPushing big whips, chains clinking love
p2066
aVBut y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
p2067
aVWe know how you speculate
p2068
aVThinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
p2069
aVClaim we're early and be showing up extra late, love
p2070
aVThey don't be saying how I'm humble, I'm hella nice
p2071
aVOr that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice
p2072
aVThey just tell you all the rumors they heard
p2073
aVAnd we laugh soon as you come and tell me like Amel and Bryce
p2074
aVMy groove theory is that when you too cheery
p2075
aVThey try to bring you down to the level they at
p2076
aVWell when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
p2077
aVThat's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
p2078
aVBut, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart girl
p2079
aVNah, they probably think I'll break your heart girl
p2080
aVHaha, I can't lie, you probably right about it
p2081
aVAnd if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it
p2082
aVBut I hate it when they judge me on how I sound
p2083
aVI mean I spit that influential shit from my town
p2084
aVI don't know why you sitting on the couch
p2085
aVWhen you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
p2086
aVYou think taking your purse off
p2087
aVWill lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
p2088
aVAt least I got status because I could've been a local emcee
p2089
aVAnd you probably would've been worse off
p2090
aVSo I'mma take this hat off, and I'mma hit it till I'm back soft
p2091
aVAnd then I backs off
p2092
aVCause you thinking you can predict what happen
p2093
aVYou the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping
p2094
aVYou probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and
p2095
aVSwang dick to these hoes like nunchucks
p2096
aVWell, you can think what you want but
p2097
aVI think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut
p2098
aVYou need to get real and check out my real life
p2099
aVI ain't a tip-drill, don't care what it smell like
p2100
aVBut if you feel like putting all your notions aside
p2101
aVAnd talking to a real nigga, I'd gladly oblige
p2102
aVFirst name Phonte, I'd be pleased to date ya
p2103
aVCollege educated, got degrees in papers
p2104
aVBut I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping
p2105
aVOr rapping bout trapping you's a freak of nature
p2106
aVSuch an anomaly, speak so well
p2107
aVAnd talk so collegy, such an astonishing
p2108
aVContrast to all the bullshit you've been following
p2109
aVOn behalf of them, I offer my apologies
p2110
aVMaybe with me you'll unlearn
p2111
aVPutting all niggas in a box of concerns
p2112
aVMe, cause I ain't dumb, shit I'm well read like sunburn
p2113
aVAnd after me you'll never leave no stone unturned
p2114
aVThey say you never judge a book by its cover
p2115
aVThough you appear as materialistic, just like the others
p2116
aVSo I followed your words to take 'em in
p2117
aVAnd I don't see what you saying so they coming off paper thin
p2118
aVThat's when I felt that I would need to
p2119
aVDo more than just look you up and down to see if I could read you
p2120
aVAnd try to get inside your head only
p2121
aVNot just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me
p2122
aVSo what I learned on my path to discover?
p2123
aVYour story took one ugly turn after another
p2124
aVI saw we wasn't on the same page
p2125
aVI would've gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way
p2126
aVSo now I'm closing the case
p2127
aVYou only out for the paperback that's written all over your face
p2128
aVNo El' will never judge a book by its cover
p2129
aVUntil he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under
p2130
aVMe and you so crucial baby
p2131
aVAnd that champagne so fuchsia baby
p2132

p2133
aVAnd take you back home to St. Lucia baby

aVThat's a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
p2136
aVWhen you are wet and covered in sweat
p2137
aVI'll wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
p2138
aVI love all my feedback
p2139
aVTell me to give it to ya if you need that
p2140
aVTouch right there, whatever the speeds at
p2141
aVIf it's over fast then I promise you will relapse
p2142

p3602
aVGirl I'm gonna turn the lights off
p3603
aVThey're fittin' for what we're about to do

aVNo you hate explaining how you want it done
p3605
aVOh, oh\u2014it's 6 o'clock in the morning at the studio...
p3606
aVWhy do I feel so alone?
p3607
aVLike everybody passing through the studio
p3608
aVIs in character as if we acting out a movie role
p3609
aVTalking bullshit as if it was for you to know
p3610
aVAnd I don't have the heart to give these
p3611
aVBitch niggas the cue to go
p3612
aVSo they stick around kicking out feedback
p3613
aVAnd I entertain it as if I need that
p3614
aVI had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
p3615
aVMy privacy about the only thing I need back but
p3616
aVIt's hard to think of them polite flows
p3617
aVWhen Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes
p3618
aVAnd Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
p3619
aVAnd you still make it even when they say your flight closed
p3620
aVEyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
p3621
aVLife was so full, now this shit just being lipo'd
p3622
aVAlways said I'd say it all on the right track
p3623
aVBut in this game you only lose when you fight back
p3624
aVBlack diamond bracelets
p3625
aVShowing you the basics, I can't live and hold the camera
p3626
aVSomeone gotta tape this
p3627
aVAnd make hits like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss24 hours from greatness, I'm that close
p3628
aVDon't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
p3629
aVTransitioning from fitting in to standing out
p3630
aVLos Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South
p3631
aVWatchin' Hov's show
p3632
aVEmbarrassed to pull my camera out
p3633
aVAnd my mother embarrassed
p3634
aVTo pull my Phantom out
p3635
aVSo I park about five houses down
p3636
aVShe say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
p3637
aVBut I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
p3638
aVSo she wonder where my mind is, accounts in the minus
p3639
aVBut yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness
p3640
aVGot niggas reactin' without a sinus
p3641
aVCause what I'm working with is timeless
p3642
aVAnd promoters try to get me out to they club
p3643
aVThey say I have fun but I can't imagine how
p3644
aVCause I just seen my ex-girl, standing with my next girl
p3645
aVStanding with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now
p3646
aVAnd shit could get weird unless they all down
p3647
aVAnd so I stay clear, we from a small town
p3648
aVEverybody talks and everybody listen
p3649
aVBut somehow the truth just always comes up missing
p3650
aVI've always been something that these labels can't buy
p3651
aVEspecially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul
p3652
aVAnd Sylvia be tellin' Tez, "Damn, Drake fly"
p3653
aVAnd he just be like, "Silly motherfucker, I know
p3654
aVThat was your bad, how could you pass up on 'em?
p3655
aVHe just take them records and he gas up on 'em
p3656
aVWayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em
p3657
aVSurprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em"
p3658
aVOh they did Poe, at least they tried to
p3659
aVAnd that's what happens
p3660
aVWhen you spitting what's inside you
p3661
aVBut slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
p3662
aVAnd they think they can market you
p3663
aVHowever they decide to nahh
p3664
aVBut 40 told me to do me
p3665
aVCause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
p3666
aVAnd if you think I changed in the slightest could've fooled me
p3667
aVBoy, in my city I'm da 2-3
p3668
aVI quit school and it's not because I'm lazy
p3669
aVI'm just not the social type
p3670
aVAnd campus life is crazy understand
p3671
aVI could get money with my eyes closed
p3672
aVLost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
p3673
aVSo if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
p3674
aVSell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know
p3675
aVCause they need it much more than I ever will
p3676
aVI got new shit, I'm gettin' better still
p3677
aVLittle niggas put my name in they verses
p3678
aVCause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
p3679
aVFuture said cause this 'Ye shit you better kill
p3680
aVAnd I think this got this "Making of a Legend" feel
p3681
aVProblem with these other niggas they ain't never real
p3682
aVYea ... that's all I can say
p3683
aVHands down, I'm too proud for love
p3684
aVBut with eyes shut, it's you I'm thinkin' of
p3685
aVBut how we move from A to B, it can't be up to me
p3686
aVCause you don't know, who I was before you
p3687
aVAnd basically to see a change in me
p3688
aVI'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah
p3689
aVOh, but you're on my mind
p3690
aV(My mind, my mind, my mind, my mind)
p3691
aVOh, but maybe in time (in time, in time, in time)

p3696
aVI know you told me break their hearts
p3697
aVBut it's you I wanna take apart
p3698
aVAnd I will never ever be the first, to say it
p3699
aVBut still I, they know I\u2014
p3700
aVI would do it, push a button

p3706
aVIt was you and I and only I\u2014
p3707
aVI think I'm a little bit, little bit
p3708
aVBut only if you're a little bit
p3709
aVLittle bit in love with me
p3710
aVI hope they never find out
p3711
aVWhat they already know, know, know
p3712
aVAs soon as it's official
p3713
aVWe'll have to let it go, go, go
p3714
aVSo we don't confirm the fling
p3715
aVKeep avoiding all the questions
p3716
aVYou could teach me many things
p3717
aVI'm just scared to learn a lesson
p3718
aVThe pressure's on, both hearts beat like a metronome
p3719
aVBoth in sync like a Justin song
p3720
aVFeels so right but it's just, so wrong
p3721
aVI wonder where my world 'bout
p3722
aVWhen niggas that I know tryna take my girl out
p3723
aVAnd her friends say I ain't the one to go for
p3724
aVShe just jealous cause you always get approached more

aVAnd as for you, I think I know you're the one
p3730
aVThe closest I've come, I'm probably\u2014
p3731
aVYou know a lot of girls be...

aVHave a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
p3755
aVSweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
p3756

p3758

p3759

aVBut I probably will when Hov does
p4217
aVAnd if my tears hold value then I would drop one
p4218
aVFor every single thing he showed us
p4219
aVAnd I'll be standing in a puddle
p4220
aVI stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble
p4221
aVAnd I'mma keep it honest, I'm so tired of being subtle
p4222
aVIt's just me, 40, O, and Nik standing in a huddle
p4223
aVStaring at the members of my team
p4224
aVWho get questioned about they profit from this million dollar scheme
p4225
aVJust know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams
p4226
aVI hope you tell your families this shit ain't what it seems
p4227
aVBut y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion
p4228
aVYou know I spend money because spending time is hopeless
p4229
aVAnd know I pop bottles cause I bottle my emotions
p4230
aVAt least I put it all in the open
p4231
aVLook, fuck all y'all, we ignore feelings here
p4232
aVPremature millionaires, welcome to my realest year
p4233
aVYeah, I swear that we making a killing here
p4234
aVI should be on top of the world just chilling here
p4235
aVBut it's funny having fans
p4236
aVWho find you before anybody ever has the chance
p4237
aVAnd build you up, so you could be the biggest in the game
p4238
aVAnd realize when you're there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same
p4239
aVYeah, and plus things are just surreal at home
p4240
aVPeople think I've changed just cause my appeal has grown
p4241
aVAnd now security follow me everywhere
p4242
aVSo I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone
p4243
aVI think I'm scared of what the future holds
p4244
aVI was wishing for some things and now am used to those
p4245
aVEvery girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes
p4246
aVThe honesty of my music has left me too exposed
p4247
aVAll my old friends think I got a new crowd
p4248
aVAnd people seem to notice every time I do smile
p4249
aVI guess that mean they come few and far between
p4250
aVEven know I'm living out what you would call the dream
p4251
aVAnd my uncle ain't even messaging me
p4252
aVAnd him missing in my life is kind of messing with me
p4253
aVI hope this isn't one of those forever things
p4254
aVIt's funny how money can change everything

p4385
aVSome niggas been here for a couple, never been here again

aVWhy you think I got my head in the clouds
p4398
aVOn my last album cover?
p4399
aVThe game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
p4400

p4407
aV28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
p4408
aVLongevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
p4409
aVProlly forever if I stay in my zone
p4410
aVI speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
p4411
aVI heard a little little homie talking reckless in Vibe
p4412
aVThat's quite a platform you chose
p4413
aVYou should've kept it inside\u2014oh, you tried
p4414
aVIt's so childish calling my name on the world stage
p4415
aVYou need to act your age and not your girl's age
p4416
aVIt gets worse by the annual, my career's like a How-To manual
p4417
aVSo I guess it's understandable, man
p4418
aVOh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah
p4419
aVI know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get 'em
p4420
aVTo show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
p4421
aVI remember when it used to be music that did it
p4422
aVBut then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
p4423
aVI'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
p4424
aVI'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
p4425
aVIf me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
p4426
aVWe prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
p4427
aVBut here we are, yeah
p4428
aVLately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
p4429
aVThey scream out my failures
p4430
aVAnd whisper my accomplishments
p4431
aVBitches alter my messages like we had words
p4432
aVAnd stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
p4433
aVBitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing
p4434
aVCrazy this year\u2014fuckin' with my image
p4435
aVI've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
p4436
aVFuck it, I guess I gotta wait til next year
p4437
aVAnd I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
p4438
aV'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
p4439
aVNobody lookin' out for nobody
p4440
aVMaybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
p4441
aVInstead of bein' somebody that makes the news
p4442
aVSo everybody can tweet about it
p4443
aVAnd then they start to R.I.P. about it
p4444
aVAnd four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
p4445
aVDamn, I just had to say my piece about it
p4446
aVOh, you gotta love it\u2014but they scared of the truth
p4447
aVSo back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject

aVComeback flow, once I start it's apparent
p4455
aVI'm with girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
p4456
aVBut fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions
p4457
aVAnd fuck all the judgement
p4458
aVYour content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
p4459
aVShit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
p4460
aVI wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
p4461
aVBein' number two is just being the first to lose
p4462
aVMy city dictated music, nobody seein' us
p4463
aVWinter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
p4464
aVBeen observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough

aVOh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace
p4471
aVWhy you rappin' like you come from the streets?
p4472

aVAnd I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
p4474
aVPhantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
p4475
aVI cook the beef well done on the double with cheese

p4479
aVCuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
p4480
aVI'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat
p4481
aVFeel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
p4482
aVMan, oh, you gotta love it
p4483
aVAnd on top of that it's getting harder to eat
p4484
aVRappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
p4485
aVTo think labels said they had a problem marketing me
p4486
aVAnd now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe

p4504
aVShowing how much they truly resent me
p4505
aVThey whole demeanor just spells envy, they tryna tempt me

aVBut you can see I'm pacing it so that I'm always chasing it
p4586
aVWayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
p4587
aVI hope that my success never alters our relationship
p4588
aVYeah, this life is something I would die for
p4589
aVOctober's Own but it's looking like July 4
p4590
aVI just wish they'd let you try it first
p4591
aVThis time I'm really going off, fireworks
p4592
aVOh, today it begins
p4593
aVI've missed them before
p4594
aVBut won't miss them again
p4595
aVI keep having the same dream
p4596
aVAnd I think that I just realized what it means
p4597
aVAll I see is fireworks
p4598
aVEvery night it's fireworks
p4599
aVTaking off like fireworks
p4600
aVTaking off like\u2014Oh
p4601
aVI'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
p4602
aVLook at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
p4603
aVI could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you'd fuck with me
p4604
aVWho could of predicted Lucky Strike would have you stuck with me
p4605
aVDamn, I kept my wits about me luckily
p4606
aVWhat happened between us that night? It always seems to trouble me
p4607
aVNow all of a sudden, these gossip blogs want to cover me
p4608
aVAnd you making it seem that it happened that way because of me
p4609
aVBut I was curious
p4610
aVAnd I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience
p4611
aVYou could of been the one but it wasn't that serious
p4612
aVThere was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it
p4613
aVThat felt good
p4614
aVAll in all, I learned a lesson from it though
p4615
aVYou never see it coming, you just get to see it go
p4616
aVYeah, I should've looked up in the sky at first
p4617
aVNow I can see it in her eyes, fireworks
p4618
aVEverything's the same but it feels different
p4619
aVMy dad called me up knowing that I still listen
p4620
aVAnd he's still got his foot out, guilt tripping
p4621
aVIt's been years though, I just learn to deal with it
p4622
aVFor real, me and my realtor, we built up a better rapport
p4623
aVGot my mother in a place with some better decor
p4624
aVShe searched the entire city, I let her explore
p4625
aVAnd now she's saying she's more lonely than ever before
p4626
aVHow many of our parents marriages lasted?
p4627
aVI was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
p4628
aVI'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic
p4629
aVSearching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic
p4630
aVLet's stay together 'til we're ghosts
p4631
aVI want to witness love, I never seen it close
p4632
aVYeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
p4633
aVThat's why I'm really going off, fireworks
p4634
aVThings have been so crazy and hectic
p4635
aVI shoulda gotten back by now
p4636
aVBut you know how much I wanted to make it
p4637
aVIt's probably better anyhow
p4638
aVSo if you gotta go
p4639
aVIf there's anything I should know
p4640
aVIf the spotlight makes you nervous
p4641
aVIf you're looking for a purpose
p4642
aVYou put the tea in the kettle and light it
p4643
aVPut your hand on the metal and feel it
p4644
aVBut do you even feel it anymore?
p4645
aVI remember when you thought I was joking
p4646
aVNow I'm off singing karaoke
p4647
aVFurther than I've ever been
p4648
aVIf there's any way I can help
p4649
aVIsn't it ironic that the girl I want to marry is a wedding planner
p4650
aVAnd tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta
p4651
aVDamn, of all the places you could go
p4652
aVI just thought you'd choose somewhere
p4653
aVThat had somebody that you know
p4654
aVI'm always up too late, I worry 'bout you there alone
p4655
aVIn that place you call your home
p4656
aVWarm nights and cold Patron
p4657
aVI hope that you don't get known for nothing crazy
p4658
aVCause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady
p4659
aVI know they say the first love is the sweetest
p4660
aVBut that first cut is the deepest
p4661
aVI tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets
p4662
aVSecrets you were telling everybody but me
p4663
aVDon't be fooled by the money, I'm still just young and unlucky
p4664
aVI'm surprised you couldn't tell
p4665
aVI was only trying to get ahead
p4666
aVBut the spotlight makes you nervous
p4667
aVAnd you're looking for a purpose
p4668
aVYesterday when we were getting high
p4669
aVYou were invited, you woulda liked it
p4670
aVI, I, I know you all too well
p4671
aVI said that we could kiss the past goodbye
p4672
aVBut you weren't excited
p4673
aVThere's no way to fight it
p4674
aVYou can stay but shawty here I go
p4675
aVShould I spend a weekend in Vegas?
p4676
aVI'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it
p4677
aVI mean, how could I forget?
p4678
aVMy memory's never faded
p4679
aVI can't relate to these haters
p4680
aVMy enemies never made it
p4681
aVI am still here with who I started with
p4682
aVThe game needed life, I put my heart in it
p4683
aVI blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit
p4684
aVCarry the weight for my city like a cargo ship
p4685
aVI'm 23 with a money tree
p4686
aVGrowing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds
p4687
aVIt's ironic cause my mother was a florist
p4688
aVAnd that's how she met my pops
p4689
aVAnd now my garden is enormous
p4690
aV"It's happening, Penny Lane, just like you said!"
p4691
aVI avoided the coke game and went with Sprite instead
p4692
aVUh-huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up
p4693
aVI'm trying to do better than good enough
p4694
aVWhat am I afraid of?
p4695
aVThis is supposed to be what dreams are made of
p4696
aVBut people I don't have the time to hang with
p4697
aVAlways look at me and say the same shit
p4698
aVThey say "You promised me you would never change"
p4699
aV"You promised me you would never change"
p4700
aVAm I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on?
p4701
aVWhen 40 got some shit for me to snap on, now that I'm on
p4702
aVI don't really want to worry about getting back on
p4703
aVI'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on
p4704
aVI heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
p4705
aVAnd I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
p4706
aVBut hit "redial", you'll see that I just called
p4707
aVSome chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all and
p4708
aVPlus this woman that I messed with unprotected
p4709
aVTexted saying she wished she would have kept it
p4710
aVThe one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
p4711
aVMan, I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is
p4712
aVI'm holding on by a thread
p4713
aVIt's like I'm high right now, the guy right now
p4714
aVAnd you could tell by looking in my eyes right now
p4715
aVThat nothing really comes as a surprise right now
p4716
aVCause we just having the time of our lives right now
p4717
aVI live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
p4718
aVThe other day Lissa told me that she missed the old me
p4719
aVWhich made me question when I went missing
p4720
aVAnd when I started treating my friends different
p4721
aVMaybe it was the fast paced switch up
p4722
aVOr the two guns in my face during the stick up
p4723
aVMaybe cause a girl I thought I trusted
p4724
aVWas who set the whole shit up
p4725
aVBut in fact I haven't seen them since they locked Big Rich up
p4726
aVI know but same time I'm quick to forget
p4727
aVI'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
p4728
aVBurn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
p4729
aVCause half the time I got it right I probably guessed
p4730
aVDid I just trade free time for camera time?
p4731
aVWill I blow all of this money baby, hammer time?
p4732
aVYeah, I just need some closure
p4733
aVAin't no turning back for me, I'm in it 'til it's over
p4734
aVI know way too many people here right now
p4735
aVThat I didn't know last year\u2014who the fuck are y'all?
p4736
aVI swear it feels like the last few nights
p4737
aVWe've been everywhere and back
p4738
aVBut I just can't remember it all
p4739
aVWhat am I doing? What am I doing?
p4740
aVOh yeah, that's right\u2014I'm doing me, I'm doing me
p4741
aVI'm living life right now, man
p4742
aVAnd this what I'mma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
p4743
aVBut it's far from over
p4744
aVAlright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
p4745
aVNever drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
p4746
aVMaking sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
p4747
aVAbout to set it off in this bitch: Jada Pinkett
p4748
aVI shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
p4749
aVYou too fine to be laying down in bed alone
p4750
aVI could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
p4751
aVI swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
p4752
aVAbout to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
p4753
aVAll I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
p4754
aVSuper good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
p4755
aVI did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
p4756
aV"Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me neither"
p4757
aVBut point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
p4758
aVIt wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
p4759
aVWhen I should be throwing ones, bitch, I run it
p4760
aVOne thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
p4761
aVAnd I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
p4762
aVSo they tell me that they love me
p4763
aVI know better than that, it's just game
p4764
aVIt's just what comes with the fame
p4765
aVAnd I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
p4766
aVBut I really can't complain, everything is kosher
p4767
aVTwo thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
p4768
aVI really can't see the end getting any closer
p4769
aVBut I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
p4770
aVSo I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
p4771
aVCan you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
p4772

aVYou can thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
p5277
aVI'm on the brink of influential, I'm here for you niggas
p5278
aVI guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
p5279
aVI must have been hard to watch, what a year for you niggas
p5280
aVIt's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
p5281
aVYou got your resolutions, we just got reservations
p5282
aVLiving out a dream it feels like I stayed up
p5283
aVAnd we just want to party, Patron straight up
p5284
aVFuck that old shit, I'm on new things
p5285
aVOVO Clique, Red Wing Boot Gang
p5286
aVYeah we want it all, half was never the agreement
p5287
aVWho would have thought the route we'd chosen
p5288
aVWould ever end up the scenic?
p5289
aVI can relate to kids going straight to the league
p5290
aVWhen they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
p5291
aVAnd that's around the time
p5292
aVThat your idols become your rivals
p5293
aVYou make friends with Mike
p5294
aVBut got to A.I. him for your survival
p5295
aVDamn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous
p5296
aVCause we want to be them, and they want to be us
p5297
aVSo on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment
p5298
aVThat you take for granted, you can thank me now

aVThat's how you know it's going down
p5307
aVIn case another chance never comes around
p5308
aVShallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
p5309
aVI think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women
p5310
aVI think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me I'll miss it
p5311
aVCause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
p5312
aVMan, the good girls went silent on me
p5313
aVThey got a boyfriend, or left for college on me
p5314
aVAnd all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now
p5315
aVThat make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
p5316
aVBut do I ever come up in discussion
p5317
aVOver double pump lattes and low fat muffins?
p5318
aVDo I? Or is missing what we had out of the question?
p5319
aVI'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
p5320
aVI got flows for the Marilyn Monroes
p5321

aV\u2018Cause if they did, we gonna be in some trouble
p6092
aVWe gonna be in some trouble, trouble
p6093

aV'Cause you are the death of me
p6097
aVLookin' in the mirror, I'm embarrassed
p6098
aVI'm feelin' like a suicidal terrorist
p6099
aVReact like an infant whenever you are mentioned
p6100
aVMind over matter never worked for my nemesis
p6101
aVI'm in the matter of man arm wrestlin' hands I was dealt
p6102
aVWhen I said the music business was all I needed
p6103
aVWhen I got it I was greeted by an alien
p6104
aVThat said last year that she slept with a Canadian
p6105
aVThat gave him an addiction that'd keep him in Mercedes Benz
p6106
aVBright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
p6107
aVMy vice is similar, women love when you're my type
p6108
aVAnd you're winnin' from everything that your palm write
p6109
aVPut her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
p6110
aVDevil in a dress, Platinum Chanel, live the ambiance all
p6111
aV'Cause the audience one day said I would do it
p6112
aVSo instead of a verse bein' read
p6113
aVI'ma go and get some head off the strength of my music
p6114
aVI tell a bad bitch yo' ass too fat, Capitalize That
p6115
aVAnd your weave look good with the Indian tracks
p6116
aVTrackin' device on your used 5 series
p6117
aVI don't call back, just blame it on your Canadian
p6118
aVThe same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto

p6122
aVA white waitress on standby when we need her
p6123
aVA black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep

aVNo doors, all that nigga was missin' was Aaliyah
p6125
aVFelt like the initiation, a reality livin' in the matrix
p6126
aVWe talk casually about the industry
p6127
aVAnd how the women be the taste makers for the shit we makin'
p6128
aVThen he said that he was the same age as\u2026 myself
p6129
aVAnd it didn't help 'cause it made me even more rude and impatient
p6130
aVSo blame it on Mr. OVOXO
p6131
aVThe reason why I'm breathin' all the vanity I know
p6132
aVThe reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
p6133
aVBut I live a double life and need to let her go
p6134
aVThe reason why the highlight was when he said:
p6135
aVYou belong to the people when you're outside
p6136
aVSo dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy
p6137
aVFull of fame and bury yourself alive, then I died
p6138
aVBridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
p6139
aVRich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
p6140
aVProbably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
p6141
aVCan't even see straight, I can't even see it straight
p6142
aVUh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
p6143
aVLive a little, 'cause niggas die a lot
p6144
aVAnd lie a lot but I'm the truth -- that's right, I fucking said it
p6145
aVThe living proof that you ain\u2019t gotta die to get to heaven
p6146
aVYou girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
p6147
aVHow'd I know, how'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
p6148
aVI can tell a lie if you ask me my whereabouts

aVBut I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
p6150
aVRap and bitches, rappin' bitches, bitches
p6151
aVAnd rappin', rappin' and bitches until all of it switches
p6152
aVI swear, it's been two years since somebody asked me who I was
p6153
aVI'm the greatest man, I said that before I knew I was
p6154
aVThat's what's important, what really happened before this
p6155
aVWhen me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
p6156
aVSinging "walking like a man, finger on the trigger
p6157
aVI got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah"
p6158
aVWith fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
p6159
aVI was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
p6160
aVThat was back in the days, Acura days
p6161
aVI was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways
p6162
aVPeople always ask how I got my nice things
p6163
aVTake my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
p6164

aVSometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance
p6171
aVTell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
p6172
aVDo me like the women from my town would
p6173

aVAnd every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
p6180
aVSo why am I in class if this is who I'm trying to be like
p6181
aVSo I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
p6182
aVAs soon I realize that turning papers in won't get me paid

p6184
aVI'm counting all day like a clock on the wall

p6449
aV(Oh ho, oh ho)
p6450
aVWe live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together
p6451
aVBut we sure make it feel like we're together
p6452
aVBecause we're scared to see each other with somebody else
p6453
aVPeople around you should really have nothing to say
p6454
aVMe, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
p6455
aVAnd the weekends here, started it right, even if you only get part of it right
p6456
aVLive for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
p6457
aVDying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
p6458
aVIf they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing
p6459
aVHouston girls, love the way it goes down
p6460
aVAtlanta girls, love the way it goes down

p6464
aVYou musta done this before, this can't be your first time
p6465
aVWe musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
p6466
aVYou got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
p6467
aVThey keep telling me don't save you, if I ignore all that advice
p6468
aVThen something isn't right, then who will I complain to?
p6469
aVBut the weekend's here, started it right, even if I only get part of it right
p6470
aVYou got your guards up, I do too, there's things we might discover
p6471
aVCause you got a past and I do too, we're perfect for each other
p6472
aVCause to her I'm just a rapper, and soon she'll have met another
p6473
aVSo if tonight's an accident, tomorrow we'll recover
p6474
aVAnd I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by it's cover
p6475
aVI don't wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
p6476
aVAbout her, and she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it
p6477
aVI know what makes her smile, but I won't know what makes her different
p6478
aVOr should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
p6479
aVI know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last.. Tunechi
p6480
aVShower her with dollar tips

aVAnd this saddens me, I see the pecking order
p6486
aVQuote-unquote "bad bitches" work the whole floor
p6487
aVThose that get laughed at sit off in the corner
p6488
aVLike a lab rat nobody want her
p6489
aVNiggas that are married don't wanna go home
p6490
aVBut we look up to them, they wish they were us
p6491
aVThey want some new trim, we lust for some trust
p6492
aVNow the both of us are colorblind
p6493
aVCause the other side looks greener
p6494
aVWhich leaves your turf in the Boise state
p6495
aVCan't see her play or the team, cuz
p6496
aVEverybody has an addiction; mine happens to be you
p6497
aVAnd those who say they don't
p6498
aVSouls will later on say to them "that ain't true"
p6499
aVAll of them will have an opinion
p6500
aVBut y'all know what y'all can do with them
p6501
aVBut if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
p6502
aVTo a place you can stick that in

p6506
aVOr something that's familiar maybe
p6507
aVAnd I can tell that she wants a baby
p6508
aVAnd I can yell, girl, that you're crazy
p6509
aVOh what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
p6510
aVPlease be careful: bitches got the rabies
p6511
aVIt\u2019s like \u201909 in your basement
p6512
aVAnd I\u2019m in love with Nebby
p6513
aVAnd I still love her but it fell through because I wasn\u2019t ready
p6514
aVAnd your back hurt and your neck hurt
p6515
aVAnd you smoking heavy
p6516
aVAnd I sit next to you and I lecture you
p6517
aVBecause those are deadly
p6518
aVAnd then you ash it and we argue
p6519
aVAbout spending money on bullshit
p6520
aVAnd you tell me I\u2019m just like my father
p6521
aVMy one button, you push it
p6522

aVAnd I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you sorry
p6524
aVYou love me and I love you
p6525
aVAnd your heart hurts, mine does too
p6526
aVAnd it's just words and they cut deep
p6527
aVBut it's our world, it's just us two
p6528
aVI see painkillers on the kitchen counter
p6529
aVI hate to see it all hurt so bad
p6530
aVBut maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard
p6531
aVIf you were healthy and it weren't so bad
p6532
aVUh, maybe I should walk up the street
p6533
aVAnd try and get a job at the bank
p6534
aVCause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
p6535
aVWe'll probably end up robbing the bank
p6536
aVThen Wayne calls up my phone
p6537

aVBefore we do this I just wanna say thanks man. Thank you for the years you spent working with some of Toronto's true legends honing your craft. Thanks you for dropping everything to work with me after we met and realized we had something special. Thank you for pushing yourself despite the fact you should be resting to achieve an end goal that we are both obsessed with. Thank you for listening to me vent and talking me off ledges. Thank you for talking me out of sending every good song I make to someone else \U0001f602. Thank you for reminding me that we set out to do something more than just have the biggest song in the club or the biggest song of the month. Thank you for building SOTA. Thank you for caring about the people in this city as much as I do. Thank you for a lifetime of hard work and surreal moments. This story would have gone a lot different without you. Thank you 40 (aka DB40 aka Cuarenta aka Bibber aka My brother). Text me when you are ready to start the next one \U0001f602\U0001f602\U0001f602  @ovo40

p10562
aVYou know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I\u2019m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high.
