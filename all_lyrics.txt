aVThank you Ms. Graham for coming today. You look very nice today, sorry, that's not professional, I guess. They say in Canada, don't mingle business with pleasure, or something like that So, we have to talk about Aubrey, or how he likes to be called, Drake. As I always like to say, there is room for improvement in his learning from piano. He talks a lot, huh? He socialize when I'm teaching. Okay, and when it's time for him to play, he doesn't have pianist hands. If you need example: me, Mozart, and Ray Charles all of us have pianist hands. I'm the only one living with this hands, I guess. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding. Umm it seems like he likes the music and he obviously has a reason, but there is so much room for improvement, you know? Speaking of improvement, I don't think you, Ms. Graham need any of it. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding, haha

p5055
aVI'm getting money just taking care of me, girl
p5056
aVYeah, this dedicated to Canada man
p5057
aVThe whole up North\u000aA lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the Winter\u000aBut listen
p5058
aVI met this new girl late June or early July\u000aI called her a bunch of times but she barely replied
p5059
aVNow it's December, I'm driving, and she's like "Where's my hi?"
p5060
aVIt's weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy
p5061
aVSee that was a segue,
p5062
aVI believe the matter\u000aIs what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter
p5063
aVWhere the Timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up\u000aDrug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up\u000aWhere girls become exes from Summer's caught ho'in\u000aThe winter cars come out, the summer cars go in
p5064
aVAnd some places is breezy, and some it start snow-ing\u000aAnd if you planning family vacations you better know when
p5065
aVBut some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city\u000aInstead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity\u000aCause mom stays up late, she seen them videos\u000aWhere Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!
p5066
aVYeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man\u000aA lot of girls y'know, wanna get close. you might think they the one\u000aBut just wait, nah mean, take it slow
p5067
aVForget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach
p5068
aVShe lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet\u000aSince I'm driving, I ask her how to get to the suite
p5069
aVShe doesn't answer
p5070
aVopens the door and just gets in the seat\u000aShe throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat
p5071
aVShe's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet
p5072
aVThen she says "I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat\u000aI mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat\u000aI love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good\u000aThere's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat"
p5073
aVOff this I'm kinda takin it back for a second
p5074
aVI get her number she tells me to call her after this session
p5075
aVAnd so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch
p5076
aVUntil we end up sexin' and now my heart attached
p5077
aVI'm thinkin off I should've been more Southern
p5078
aVShe love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench
p5079
aVBut, my boy say I'm actin different, because I lay downtown\u000aAnd I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench
p5080
aVShe tellin everyone I'mma hold here down\u000aTell everyone I'm the prince up in this cold clear town\u000aAnd stupid me I just listen to her
p5081
aVInstead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round
p5082
aVBut then Spring shows up, and it's Dallas in this bitch
p5083
aVThe weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
p5084
aVWhen we were together it seeming like way back when\u000aBall players hop on the plane and make it way back in\u000aSee she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa
p5085
aVInstead of saving for marriage, she saving for carrabanna
p5086
aVAnd it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime\u000aI guess, I lost another one to the wintertime
p5087
aV(give me a second to gather my thoughts)\u000aAnd watching winter turn to spring (Such a beautiful day man)\u000a(Yeah man, you know we had to switch it on 'em right?)\u000aStrolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing\u000a(I'm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss)\u000a(Man, but I got something to else to tell ya baby)
p5088
aVI remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up
p5089
aVNow Drake's committed we waiting on the breakup
p5090
aVSo we can get back to them cognac nights\u000aWith dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right\u000aAnd I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
p5091
aVThe winter came and blew his cold air through\u000aBack then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her\u000aBy the end of the week I would know that crew
p5092
aVAnd we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene\u000aWith three ladies in the shot we never broke routine\u000aAt the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin'
p5093
aVWe had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen
p5094
aVBut this Summer is different it's a two man operation\u000aGranted the fact that we one man short\u000aGot love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation\u000aCause handlin' crack is a one man sport
p5095
aVInstead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin'
p5096
aVI find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'\u000aThe face, the breast, the bras, the toes
p5097
aVI'm still solo and a long night draws to a close\u000aCause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside\u000aWe'll never talk again, scary and true
p5098
aVThat song Special I recorded with Voyce well it's like a classified\u000aIt's what I'm lookin for to carry me through
p5099
aVYet I can't seem to find it, every girl that possesses it
p5100
aVOnly wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit
p5101
aVAnd when they talk about they past and lovers\u000aAnd you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others
p5102
aVThere's also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive
p5103
aVStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring\u000aStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring\u000aStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring
p5104
aVAnd realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho!
p5105
aVYeah, uh, I told ya'll I had a story for you right
p5106
aVUh, ya man, it's what it is
p5107
aVAnd now, I'm proud to have her like Montreal to the frizzench
p5108
aVYet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride
p5109
aVAll night I've, been staring, can you tell I want you?\u000aCan't be too, wide open, there's nothing, I won't do\u000aOh, just thought you should know
p5110
aVThat's when you start to laugh\u000aSaying I just want what I can't have
p5111
aVWon't even give me a chance\u000aClaiming I'm just not as serious as you\u000aShorty if you only knew, this is serious
p5112
aVI wish I, wasn't famous\u000aI wish I, was still in school\u000aSo that I could have you in my dorm room

p5648
aVI'm on the brink of influential,
p5649
aVI'm here for you niggas
p5650
aVI guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
p5651
aVI must have been hard to watch, what a year for you niggas
p5652
aVIt's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating\u000aYou got your resolutions, we just got reservations
p5653
aVLiving out a dream it feels like I stayed up
p5654
aVAnd we just want to party, Patron straight up
p5655
aVFuck that old shit, I'm on new things\u000aOVO Clique, Red Wing Boot Gang
p5656
aVYeah we want it all, half was never the agreement\u000aWho would have thought the route we'd chosen\u000aWould ever end up the scenic?
p5657
aVI can relate to kids going straight to the league\u000aWhen they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
p5658
aVAnd that's around the time\u000aThat your idols become your rivals\u000aYou make friends with Mike\u000aBut got to A.I. him for your survival
p5659
aVDamn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous\u000aCause we want to be them, and they want to be us

p5663
aVRappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them\u000aCause they think that I can help them\u000aGet back to where they fell from
p5664
aVBut drink up, cause everyone here is good tonight\u000aExcept the niggas that I came with, they good for life
p5665
aVThat's how you know it's going down\u000aIn case another chance never comes around
p5666
aVShallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
p5667
aVI think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women\u000aI think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me I'll miss it\u000aCause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
p5668
aVMan, the good girls went silent on me\u000aThey got a boyfriend, or left for college on me\u000aAnd all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now\u000aThat make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
p5669
aVBut do I ever come up in discussion\u000aOver double pump lattes and low fat muffins?
p5670
aVDo I? Or is missing what we had out of the question?\u000aI'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
p5671
aVI got flows for the Marilyn Monroes\u000aWho was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes
p5672
aVThey hear about your cons, but focus on your pros\u000aAnd love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
p5673
aVBut those same ones from your area will grow into women\u000aThat are ready to get married at hello
p5674
aVBecause of what they allowed,
p5675
aVwhere are they all now?\u000aI know they're somewhere watching\u000aSo I'm trying to make them proud
p5676
aVSearching for the meaning, you'll find it next to me
p5677
aVThey tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see
p5678
aVI'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?
p5679
aVThey say the doors will open up\u000aSoon as you find the missing key
p5680
aVThat's probably why I'm in this bitch shining
p5681
aVJump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
p5682
aVI rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
p5683
aVAnd the bandwagon's full\u000aBut you can try and run behind it, I'm sorry
p5684
aVPoolside drinking, Margarita rounds
p5685
aVShout out to my city though I hardly be in town
p5686
aVI'm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown
p5687
aVAnd I know life is just a game\u000aIn which the cards are facing down
p5688
aVI'm in a world where things are taken, never given
p5689
aVHow long they choose to love you will never be your decision\u000aAnd I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen\u000aSo while I'm still here in this position
p5690
aVIt's 10 O'clock on a Wednesday and I know your home\u000aDrivin up and down your street\u000aHopin that you'll come outside

p6632
aVwhen I'm dismissed after a tedious listen\u000aI sit at home and say I should of been a pediatrician
p6633
aVAn artist like Pablo, maybe Petey's assistant
p6634
aVSo, if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady\u000aDaughter, and her grandson, nigga get the handgun
p6635

p6659
aVCause black is black honey, even if he's very light
p6660
aVAlways brutally honest, and so I pin it to they faces
p6661
aVI live it so the case is, whether Drake is
p6662
aVWay ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist

p6664
aVThere's questions that need to be answered that's not on the test

p6675
aVThey don't be saying how I'm humble, I'm hella nice\u000aOr that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice
p6676
aVThey just tell you all the rumors they heard\u000aAnd we laugh soon as you come and tell me like Amel and Bryce\u000aMy groove theory
p6677
aVThat's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
p6678
aVAnd if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it
p6679
aVBut I hate it when they judge me on how I sound\u000aI mean I spit that influential shit from my town
p6680
aVYou probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and\u000aSwang dick to these hoes like nunchucks\u000aWell, you can think what you want but\u000aI think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut
p6681
aVYou need to get real and check out my real life\u000aI ain't a tip-drill, don't care what it smell like\u000aBut if you feel like putting all your notions aside\u000aAnd talking to a real nigga, I'd gladly oblige
p6682
aVFirst name Phonte, I'd be pleased to date ya\u000aCollege educated, got degrees in papers
p6683
aVMaybe with me you'll unlearn\u000aPutting all niggas in a box of concerns
p6684
aVThey say you never judge a book by its cover\u000aThough you appear as materialistic, just like the others
p6685
aVSo I followed your words to take 'em in\u000aAnd I don't see what you saying so they coming off paper thin\u000aThat's when I felt that I would need to\u000aDo more than just look you up and down to see if I could read you
p6686
aVYou only out for the paperback that's written all over your face\u000aNo El' will never judge a book by its cover
p6687
aVDon't judge me man
p6688

aVMe, 'Te and El' bout to prove 'em wrong though
p6691
aVUh, we know what you're thinking love

aV, love
p6698
aVis that when you too cheery
p6699
aVThey try to bring you down to the level they at
p6700
aVWell when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
p6701
aVBut, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart girl
p6702
aVNah, they probably think I'll break your heart girl
p6703
aVHaha, I can't lie, you probably right about it
p6704
aVI don't know why you sitting on the couch
p6705
aVWhen you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
p6706
aVYou think taking your purse off
p6707
aVWill lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
p6708
aVAt least I got status because I could've been a local emcee
p6709
aVAnd you probably would've been worse off
p6710
aVSo I'mma take this hat off, and I'mma hit it till I'm back soft
p6711
aVAnd then I backs off
p6712
aVCause you thinking you can predict what happen
p6713
aVYou the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping
p6714
aVBut I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping
p6715
aVOr rapping bout trapping you's a freak of nature
p6716
aVSuch an anomaly, speak so well
p6717
aVAnd talk so collegy, such an astonishing
p6718
aVContrast to all the bullshit you've been following
p6719
aVOn behalf of them, I offer my apologies
p6720
aVMe, cause I ain't dumb, shit I'm well read like sunburn
p6721
aVAnd after me you'll never leave no stone unturned
p6722
aVAnd try to get inside your head only
p6723
aVNot just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me
p6724
aVSo what I learned on my path to discover?
p6725
aVYour story took one ugly turn after another
p6726
aVI saw we wasn't on the same page
p6727
aVI would've gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way
p6728
aVSo now I'm closing the case
p6729
aVUntil he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under
p6730
aVI don't know, first you caught the hands\u000aThen you took the stand\u000aIt's a joke, but you say you real\u2014I don't understand
p6731
aVWe evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls\u000aSwear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low
p6732
aVI don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the road

p6739
aVTwo-faced niggas back around with the three face\u000aDamn, ol' triple double, Russ face\u000aWatch with the bust face\u000aNever-met-the-plug-but-I-rap-about-the-plug face\u000aNever-met-myself, I-don't-remember-who-I-was face

p6741
aVAll that Drake hysteria\u000a6 side, East side, all that for my area
p6742
aVYou know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I\u2019m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days.
p6743
aVWhen others go low, we go high.

p6925
aVSometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough\u000aTo feel what I'm about to say in this song
p6926
aVWhen they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself\u000aAnd you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
p6927
aVAnd they try to make you out as a lie
p6928
aVIt's ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason\u000aIt's a lose lose why even try
p6929
aVWhen your ideas so frequently get rejected
p6930
aVpeople just get neglected\u000aAnd they never really know how to feel
p6931
aVPhone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics\u000aAnd the motives to try and make them a mill
p6932
aVYou never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks
p6933
aVand\u000aNiggas wanna say that you ain't around
p6934
aVI mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming\u000aThat you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town
p6935
aVAnd the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin' is fresher\u000aThan most of these rappers running the game
p6936
aVCertain people will copy what's in the past to turn the profit with cash\u000aThere's time I would have done it the same
p6937
aVI mean I got me a Range, Also got me a guilty conscience\u000aThat made you tell anybody I meet that I rent
p6938
aVSometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers\u000aAnd watched the game from the bleachers
p6939
aVBecause I'm really tend to need what I spent
p6940
aVIn a house that I promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time\u000aI wasted out late at the club
p6941
aVInstead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I'm working hard on the winter\u000aSo this album is a labor of love
p6942
aVYou say as long as I'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats\u000aThat she can rest without a toss and a turn
p6943
aVBecause she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on TV\u000aThat's exactly why I often get burned
p6944
aVThat there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping
p6945
aVChorus: (x4)
p6946
aVYou gonna try to try harder cuz
p6947
aVTry harder cuz

p7699
aVIf we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me\u000aYou overnight celebrity, you one day star\u000aSwear I Told You that I'm in this bitch for eternity\u000aI am a reflection of all of your insecurities\u000aBehind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping\u000aDone talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
