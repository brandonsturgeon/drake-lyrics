aVThank you Ms. Graham for coming today. You look very nice today, sorry, that's not professional, I guess. They say in Canada, don't mingle business with pleasure, or something like that So, we have to talk about Aubrey, or how he likes to be called, Drake. As I always like to say, there is room for improvement in his learning from piano. He talks a lot, huh? He socialize when I'm teaching. Okay, and when it's time for him to play, he doesn't have pianist hands. If you need example: me, Mozart, and Ray Charles all of us have pianist hands. I'm the only one living with this hands, I guess. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding. Umm it seems like he likes the music and he obviously has a reason, but there is so much room for improvement, you know? Speaking of improvement, I don't think you, Ms. Graham need any of it. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding, haha

p5219
aVI can relate to kids going straight to the league\u000aWhen they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
p5220
aVAnd that's around the time\u000aThat your idols become your rivals\u000aYou make friends with Mike\u000aBut got to A.I. him for your survival
p5221

p5229
aVI think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women\u000aI think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me I'll miss it\u000aCause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
p5230
aVMan, the good girls went silent on me\u000aThey got a boyfriend, or left for college on me\u000aAnd all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now\u000aThat make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
p5231
aVBut do I ever come up in discussion\u000aOver double pump lattes and low fat muffins?
p5232
aVDo I? Or is missing what we had out of the question?\u000aI'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
p5233
aVI got flows for the Marilyn Monroes\u000aWho was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes
p5234
aVThey hear about your cons, but focus on your pros\u000aAnd love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
p5235
aVBut those same ones from your area will grow into women\u000aThat are ready to get married at hello
p5236
aVBecause of what they allowed,
p5237
aVwhere are they all now?\u000aI know they're somewhere watching\u000aSo I'm trying to make them proud
p5238
aVSearching for the meaning, you'll find it next to me
p5239
aVThey tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see
p5240
aVI'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?
p5241
aVThey say the doors will open up\u000aSoon as you find the missing key

aVJump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
p5244

p5250
aVI'm in a world where things are taken, never given
p5251
aVHow long they choose to love you will never be your decision\u000aAnd I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen\u000aSo while I'm still here in this position
p5252
aVI've got it made thats what I'm talking about\u000aGoing down to the fashion store and get myself fitted out\u000aGoing down to the dealers buy myself a brand new car\u000aSo me and my lady can ride

aVYou know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I\u2019m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days.

aVI can never sleep 'til morning on all my quiet nights\u000aBut you can rest assure that my mind is right
p7078
aVGet no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days\u000aNever stick around to see shit change
p7079
aVGet lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'\u000aSeasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
p7080
aVWent from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV\u000aTo not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' bis'\u000aI can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
p7081
aVDistractions will do you in, in the truest sense\u000aEspecially people that want to lecture me\u000aAnd frame it like they just want the best for me\u000aOr they check for me, whatever splits it up\u000aSo there's more for them and there's less for me\u000aThey don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me\u000aNo one's done it successfully
p7082
aV7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
p7083
aVLast verse that I gotta do is always like surgery\u000aAlways tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me\u000aThat's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency\u000aLast chance I get to make sure that you take it personally\u000aTake this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
p7084
aVIf we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me\u000aYou overnight celebrity, you one day star\u000aSwear I Told You that I'm in this bitch for eternity\u000aI am a reflection of all of your insecurities\u000aBehind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping\u000aDone talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
p7085
aVThere's real ones around me\u000aI want to make sure they learn from me
p7086
aVI want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety\u000aHe can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
p7087
aVMy life is centered 'round competition and currency
p7088
aVTakin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery\u000aMaybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me\u000aI'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary
p7089
aVMore Life
p7090
aVYeah, 9th Wonder!
p7091
aVClaim we're early and be showing up extra late
p7092
aVThey don't be saying how I'm humble, I'm hella nice\u000aOr that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice
p7093
aVThey just tell you all the rumors they heard\u000aAnd we laugh soon as you come and tell me like Amel and Bryce\u000aMy groove theory
p7094
aVThat's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
p7095
aVAnd if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it
p7096
aVBut I hate it when they judge me on how I sound\u000aI mean I spit that influential shit from my town
p7097
aVYou probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and\u000aSwang dick to these hoes like nunchucks\u000aWell, you can think what you want but\u000aI think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut
p7098
aVYou need to get real and check out my real life\u000aI ain't a tip-drill, don't care what it smell like\u000aBut if you feel like putting all your notions aside\u000aAnd talking to a real nigga, I'd gladly oblige
p7099
aVFirst name Phonte, I'd be pleased to date ya\u000aCollege educated, got degrees in papers
p7100
aVMaybe with me you'll unlearn\u000aPutting all niggas in a box of concerns
p7101
aVThey say you never judge a book by its cover\u000aThough you appear as materialistic, just like the others
p7102
aVSo I followed your words to take 'em in\u000aAnd I don't see what you saying so they coming off paper thin\u000aThat's when I felt that I would need to\u000aDo more than just look you up and down to see if I could read you
p7103
aVYou only out for the paperback that's written all over your face\u000aNo El' will never judge a book by its cover
p7104
aVDon't judge me man
p7105
aVThey tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
p7106
aVThey say we lack substance
p7107
aVMe, 'Te and El' bout to prove 'em wrong though
p7108
aVUh, we know what you're thinking love
p7109
aVYou think we out smoking and drinking love
p7110
aVPushing big whips, chains clinking love
p7111
aVBut y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
p7112
aVWe know how you speculate
p7113
aVThinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
p7114
aV, love
p7115
aVis that when you too cheery
p7116
aVThey try to bring you down to the level they at
p7117
aVWell when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
p7118
aVBut, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart girl
p7119
aVNah, they probably think I'll break your heart girl
p7120
aVHaha, I can't lie, you probably right about it
p7121
aVI don't know why you sitting on the couch
p7122
aVWhen you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
p7123
aVYou think taking your purse off
p7124
aVWill lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
p7125
aVAt least I got status because I could've been a local emcee
p7126
aVAnd you probably would've been worse off
p7127
aVSo I'mma take this hat off, and I'mma hit it till I'm back soft
p7128
aVAnd then I backs off
p7129
aVCause you thinking you can predict what happen
p7130
aVYou the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping
p7131
aVBut I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping
p7132
aVOr rapping bout trapping you's a freak of nature
p7133
aVSuch an anomaly, speak so well
p7134
aVAnd talk so collegy, such an astonishing
p7135
aVContrast to all the bullshit you've been following
p7136
aVOn behalf of them, I offer my apologies
p7137
aVMe, cause I ain't dumb, shit I'm well read like sunburn
p7138
aVAnd after me you'll never leave no stone unturned
p7139
aVAnd try to get inside your head only
p7140
aVNot just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me
p7141
aVSo what I learned on my path to discover?
p7142
aVYour story took one ugly turn after another
p7143
aVI saw we wasn't on the same page
p7144
aVI would've gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way
p7145
aVSo now I'm closing the case

p7243
aVThat's how I do it holla at me
p7244
aVAnd thats it
p7245
aVSometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough\u000aTo feel what I'm about to say in this song
p7246
aVWhen they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself\u000aAnd you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
p7247
aVAnd they try to make you out as a lie
p7248
aVIt's ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason\u000aIt's a lose lose why even try
p7249
aVWhen your ideas so frequently get rejected
p7250
aVpeople just get neglected\u000aAnd they never really know how to feel
p7251
aVPhone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics\u000aAnd the motives to try and make them a mill
p7252
aVYou never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks
p7253
aVand\u000aNiggas wanna say that you ain't around
p7254
aVI mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming\u000aThat you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town
p7255
aVAnd the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin' is fresher\u000aThan most of these rappers running the game
p7256
aVCertain people will copy what's in the past to turn the profit with cash\u000aThere's time I would have done it the same
p7257
aVI mean I got me a Range, Also got me a guilty conscience\u000aThat made you tell anybody I meet that I rent
p7258
aVSometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers\u000aAnd watched the game from the bleachers
p7259
aVBecause I'm really tend to need what I spent
p7260
aVIn a house that I promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time\u000aI wasted out late at the club
p7261
aVInstead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I'm working hard on the winter\u000aSo this album is a labor of love
p7262
aVYou say as long as I'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats\u000aThat she can rest without a toss and a turn
p7263
aVBecause she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on TV\u000aThat's exactly why I often get burned
p7264
aVThat there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping
p7265
aVChorus: (x4)
p7266
aVYou gonna try to try harder cuz
p7267

p7307
aVAnd when you\u2019re fucking someone else just fuck her like she ain't me"
p7308
aVDamn, those words are scary, those words are scary virgin Mary\u000aI just tell her to spare me
p7309
aVI was in love 2 years ago and gave the baggage to my ex\u000aIt\u2019s all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
p7310
aVI hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don\u2019t I?\u000aI get off topic don\u2019t I? I get it poppin\u2019 don\u2019t I?\u000aI\u2019ll end up stopping won\u2019t I? And by the time I end up stopping\u000aYou\u2019ll be rocking one of the rings you pointed out while shopping with a nigga don\u2019t lie
p7311
aVShe\u2019s losing it right now,
p7312
aVcause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been moving in by now
p7313
aVBut instead we're moving slow -- I guess she's used to it by now
p7314
aVAnd she gives me all her trust and I'm abusing it right now
p7315
aVBut this money coming in is just confusing shit right now
p7316
aVYou just told me I ain't shit and I guess I'm proving it right now
p7317
aVI'd rather be with you, but you are not around\u000aSo I'mma call somebody up and see if they be down\u000aCause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
p7318
aVHalf the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing\u000aYou leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months\u000aBut I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
p7319
aVSo she\u2019s here and we're both so gone
p7320
aVHotel to hotel, girl - I could use your company\u000aFull name and birthday, I book a flight, you come to me
p7321
aVBut she don't want a weekend - she wants all of me or none of me
p7322
aVIf she can't work with all of me then she say she done with me
p7323
aVYou say that you over me you always end up under me\u000aYou know how it goes - don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me\u000aDon't start with yo shit - I put you back in your place
p7324
aVShe tells me "I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face"
p7325
aVAnd hang up yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you\u000aLike I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with, too
p7326
aVAnd whoever I be with, they got nothing on you\u000aThat's just something to do when there's nothing to do
p7327
aVYeah, but she's losing it right now
p7328
aVShe has choices she should make I think she's choosing it right now\u000aOne more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
p7329
aVYou just said I never learn I guess I'm proving it right now
p7330
aVYou used to call me on my\u000aYou used to, you used to\u000aYeah
p7331
aVYou used to call me on my cell phone\u000aLate night when you need my love\u000aCall me on my cell phone\u000aLate night when you need my love

p7334
aVI know when that hotline bling\u000aThat can only mean one thing\u000aI know when that hotline bling\u000aThat can only mean one thing
p7335

p7336
aVThese days, all I do is\u000aWonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else\u000aWonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
p7337
aVDoing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else\u000aYou don't need no one else\u000aYou don't need nobody else, no
p7338
aVWhy you never alone?\u000aWhy you always touching road?\u000aUsed to always stay at home\u000aBe a good girl, you was in the zone\u000aYeah, you should just be yourself\u000aRight now, you're someone else

aVI confess this address to you
p7363
aVAnd I'm the post man looking for a slot I can put it in
p7364
aVWith no New York number mom still upstairs
p7365
aVI'm two floors under but my room's sound proof
p7366
aVYou so tempted to satisfy your urge so you don't wonder
p7367

p7379
aVSomeone's gonna have to straighten you up
p7380
aVSomeone's gonna have to teach ya
p7381
aVYeah, that's about it\u000aThis shit sound like what being rich feel like, fo real
p7382
aVThis life shit is everywhere, you can't control it\u000aToo much going on
p7383
aVToo much, too much, too much\u000aToo much, too much, too much
p7384
aVYou, you, you\u000aMake me wanna take you down through there\u000aMake me wanna take you down through there\u000aI'll take it there
p7385
aVWhy you never come to where I stay?\u000aAlways hiding out in your New York condo
p7386
aVWhy you never come to where I stay?\u000aIf anybody knows, girl, you know, I know
p7387
aVWhy are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?\u000aWhy are we rushing and forcing it?\u2014this isn't making sense
p7388
aVWhy are we focused on things\u000aThat don't even mean nothing, girl?\u000aWhy can we not find the time\u000aAnd sit down and discuss it, girl?\u000aLet me at least tell you my side of things, man\u000aAw, man, aw, man, aw, man
p7389
aVMe and you are playing house\u000aStart thinking that I'm losing touch
p7390
aVGot a tight grip on you now\u000aMaybe I should loosen up
p7391
aVWhen I leave you and I go home\u000aI start forgetting what it is\u000aStart to think I got to get it how I live
p7392
aVWe too busy for a wedding or a kid\u000aIf I'm working then I know you working
p7393
aVKeep in touch with other women\u000aCause you make me nervous
p7394
aVI empower girls that don't deserve it\u000aI don't mean to do that shit on purpose
p7395
aVIt's just that when I go home\u000aI start forgetting what it is\u000aThe dream is over, I get lost up in the 6
p7396
aVAnd you don't ever come to where I stay\u000aYou just rather stay up in your New York condo
p7397
aVYou don't ever come to where I stay\u000aIf anybody knows, girl you know, I know
p7398
aVWhy are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?\u000aYou know how sticky these situations get
p7399
aVYou go up higher than me some days\u000aYou know what I think we could be some day
p7400
aVLet me at least show you my side of things, man\u000aAw, man, aw, man, aw, man
p7401
aVWhat up, Lupe?\u000aChi-Town, check
p7402
aVMy style is very Tennessee mixed with some Terry Kennedy
p7403
aVPeople barely remember me from back in the day
p7404
aVI done got some contacts and threw the glasses away\u000aThe time it took me to get cool was a massive delay
p7405
aVIt gets boring growing up in Memphis\u000aTryna become a pro, but keep showing up apprentice
p7406
aVMama probably would've done anything to prevent this\u000aCause every single time I break a board, it gets expensive
p7407
aVLuckily, my aunt workin' as a nurse\u000aSo every time I needed something, she just reach up in her purse
p7408
aVAnd plus, she'd always give me speeches on the first\u000aIf I'm stayin' in her house, then I need to get some work
p7409
aVI tell her I was there on vacation\u000aShe said, "You need to be doing something other than skatin'
p7410
aVWhy don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement?\u000aI'mma let him know that you comin', honey, he's waitin'"
p7411
aVPlaying chess, looking through some old school record ads
p7412
aVHe knew I didn't really wanna post here\u000aOpened up the window and told me that the coast clear
p7413
aVThis is each test life's ever given me\u000aA-plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
p7414
aVYes, I'm literally Larnell Lewis with a\u000aKick and a snare, a kickflip in the air
p7415
aVThe kid's sick denim jeans, put a rip in a pair\u000aJust so the space ain't restricted in here, breathe again
p7416
aVThink it's obvious that they need my soul
p7417
aVMy cousin's after Doe, like re-mi-fa-so
p7418
aVI said, "Auntie, this is a safe career"\u000aShe said, "Drake, I told you there was no skatin' here"
p7419
aV, but check
p7420
aVSo now, it's me in old school checkered plaid
p7421
aVAnd now I coast clear, take a deep breath
p7422
aVFeeling like the Pope's here, homie, this is recess
p7423
aVSo I kick, push
p7424
aVKick, push
p7425
aVCoast
p7426
aVFast as the wheels replaced
p7427
aVI gotta find another hobby just to fill the space
p7428
aVPeep the way I roll
p7429
aVJust a rebel, lookin' for a place to go
p7430
aVSo I kick
p7431
aVThen push
p7432
aVAnd coast
p7433
aVMore time with family and friends. More Life.
p7434
aVI've still got vibrations to send. More Life.
p7435
aVThey say that we could live forever\u000aAt night I pray it's true
p7436
aVI've done so much in my short time and still there's more to do
p7437
aVBut if someone should come collecting
p7438
