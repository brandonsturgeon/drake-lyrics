They say in Canada, don't mingle business with pleasure, or something like that So, we have to talk about Aubrey, or how he likes to be called, Drake. As I always like to say, there is room for improvement in his learning from piano. He talks a lot, huh? He socialize when I'm teaching. Okay, and when it's time for him to play, he doesn't have pianist hands. If you need example: me, Mozart, and Ray Charles all of us have pianist hands. I'm the only one living with this hands, I guess. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding. Umm it seems like he likes the music and he obviously has a reason, but there is so much room for improvement, you know? Speaking of improvement, I don't think you, Ms. Graham need any of it. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding, haha

p6450
aVWhat do you see when you see me?\u000aWhen did all the things I mean\u000aFrom the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?\u000aMaybe I share it with too many people\u000aBack then it used to just feel like our secret\u000aBack when I would write and not think about how they receive it\u000aI be tryna manifest the things I needed\u000aAnd look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
p6451

aVThey don't be saying how I'm humble, I'm hella nice\u000aOr that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice
p6721
aVThey just tell you all the rumors they heard\u000aAnd we laugh soon as you come and tell me like Amel and Bryce\u000aMy groove theory
p6722
aVThat's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
p6723
aVAnd if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it
p6724
aVBut I hate it when they judge me on how I sound\u000aI mean I spit that influential shit from my town
p6725
aVYou probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and\u000aSwang dick to these hoes like nunchucks\u000aWell, you can think what you want but\u000aI think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut
p6726
aVYou need to get real and check out my real life\u000aI ain't a tip-drill, don't care what it smell like\u000aBut if you feel like putting all your notions aside\u000aAnd talking to a real nigga, I'd gladly oblige
p6727
aVFirst name Phonte, I'd be pleased to date ya\u000aCollege educated, got degrees in papers
p6728
aVMaybe with me you'll unlearn\u000aPutting all niggas in a box of concerns
p6729
aVThey say you never judge a book by its cover\u000aThough you appear as materialistic, just like the others
p6730
aVSo I followed your words to take 'em in\u000aAnd I don't see what you saying so they coming off paper thin\u000aThat's when I felt that I would need to\u000aDo more than just look you up and down to see if I could read you
p6731
aVYou only out for the paperback that's written all over your face\u000aNo El' will never judge a book by its cover
p6732
aVDon't judge me man
p6733
aVThey tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
p6734
aVThey say we lack substance
p6735
aVMe, 'Te and El' bout to prove 'em wrong though
p6736
aVUh, we know what you're thinking love
p6737
aVYou think we out smoking and drinking love
p6738
aVPushing big whips, chains clinking love
p6739
aVBut y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
p6740
aVWe know how you speculate
p6741
aVThinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
p6742
aV, love
p6743
aVis that when you too cheery
p6744
aVThey try to bring you down to the level they at
p6745
aVWell when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
p6746
aVBut, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart girl
p6747
aVNah, they probably think I'll break your heart girl
p6748
aVHaha, I can't lie, you probably right about it
p6749
aVI don't know why you sitting on the couch
p6750
aVWhen you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
p6751
aVYou think taking your purse off
p6752
aVWill lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
p6753
aVAt least I got status because I could've been a local emcee
p6754
aVAnd you probably would've been worse off
p6755
aVSo I'mma take this hat off, and I'mma hit it till I'm back soft
p6756
aVAnd then I backs off
p6757
aVCause you thinking you can predict what happen
p6758
aVYou the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping
p6759
aVBut I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping
p6760
aVOr rapping bout trapping you's a freak of nature
p6761
aVSuch an anomaly, speak so well
p6762
aVAnd talk so collegy, such an astonishing
p6763
aVContrast to all the bullshit you've been following
p6764
aVOn behalf of them, I offer my apologies
p6765
aVMe, cause I ain't dumb, shit I'm well read like sunburn
p6766
aVAnd after me you'll never leave no stone unturned
p6767
aVAnd try to get inside your head only
p6768
aVNot just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me
p6769
aVSo what I learned on my path to discover?
p6770
aVYour story took one ugly turn after another
p6771
aVI saw we wasn't on the same page
p6772
aVI would've gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way
p6773
aVSo now I'm closing the case
p6774
aVUntil he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under
p6775
aVLook...I don't know how to talk to you\u000aI don't know how to ask you if you're okay
p6776
aVMy friends always feel the need to tell me things\u000aSeems like they're just happier than us these days
p6777
aVYeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you\u000aI don't know how to be there when you need me\u000aIt feels like the only time you see me\u000aIs when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
p6778
aVYeah, and last night I think I lost my patience\u000aLast night, I got high as your expectations\u000aLast night, I came to a realization\u000aAnd I hope you can take it\u000aI hope you can take it
p6779
aVI'm too good to you\u000aI'm way too good to you\u000aYou take my love for granted\u000aI just don't understand it\u000aNo, I'm too good to you\u000aI'm way too good to you\u000aYou take my love for granted\u000aI just don't understand it

p6781
aVLately you just make me work too hard for you
p6782
aVGot me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you

aVAnd last night I think I lost my patience\u000aLast night, I got high as your expectations\u000aLast night, I came to a realization\u000aAnd I hope you can take it\u000aI hope you can take it
p6784
aVYears go by too fast\u000aI can't keep track\u000aHow long did we last?\u000aI feel bad for asking\u000aIt can't end like this\u000aWe gotta take time with this
p6785
aVCock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it\u000aLet me see if this is something I can fix
p6786
aVYou got somebody other than me\u000aDon't play the victim when you're with me\u000aFree time is costing me more than it seems\u000aSacrificing things
p6787
aVAnd I wanna tell you my intentions\u000aI wanna do the things that I mention\u000aI wanna benefit from the friendship\u000aI wanna get the late night message from you, from you
p6788

aVAll that Drake hysteria\u000a6 side, East side, all that for my area
p6983
aVYou know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I\u2019m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days.
p6984
aVWhen others go low, we go high.

p7363
aVR. Kelly
p7364
aVSometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough\u000aTo feel what I'm about to say in this song
p7365
aVWhen they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself\u000aAnd you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
p7366
aVAnd they try to make you out as a lie
p7367
aVIt's ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason\u000aIt's a lose lose why even try
p7368
aVWhen your ideas so frequently get rejected
p7369
aVpeople just get neglected\u000aAnd they never really know how to feel
p7370
aVPhone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics\u000aAnd the motives to try and make them a mill
p7371
aVYou never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks
p7372
aVand\u000aNiggas wanna say that you ain't around
p7373
aVI mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming\u000aThat you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town
p7374
aVAnd the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin' is fresher\u000aThan most of these rappers running the game
p7375
aVCertain people will copy what's in the past to turn the profit with cash\u000aThere's time I would have done it the same
p7376
aVI mean I got me a Range, Also got me a guilty conscience\u000aThat made you tell anybody I meet that I rent
p7377
aVSometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers\u000aAnd watched the game from the bleachers
p7378
aVBecause I'm really tend to need what I spent
p7379
aVIn a house that I promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time\u000aI wasted out late at the club
p7380
aVInstead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I'm working hard on the winter\u000aSo this album is a labor of love
p7381
aVYou say as long as I'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats\u000aThat she can rest without a toss and a turn
p7382
aVBecause she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on TV\u000aThat's exactly why I often get burned
p7383
aVThat there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping
p7384
aVYou gonna try to try harder cuz
p7385
aVTry harder cuz
p7386

p7391
aVA lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section\u000aOVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up
p7392
aVAnd I know who gon' take the fall with me\u000aThey right here on call with me, they all with me
p7393
aVYou could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted\u000aThey've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it?\u000aToast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
p7394
aVI worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me

aVCeesay\u2019s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday
p7396
aVKiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray
p7397
aVI dropped out right before I graduate\u000aSix credits left, my mama had her saddest day\u000a"It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait"\u000aAnd she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
p7398
aVLately I just feel so out of character\u000aThe paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
p7399
aVThoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
p7400
aVI get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison\u000aI'm gettin' straight to the point with it
p7401
aVNeed y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas\u000aFuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition\u000aIt's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business\u000aBut I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute
p7402
aVLook, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals
p7403
aVMy niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
p7404
aVWho you think runnin' this show?\u000aYou saw it in me at 20 years old
p7405
aVThe lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code
p7406
aVI got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
p7407
aVYou don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made
p7408
aVMe and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
p7409
aVNow me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game\u000aStill drop 40 with liquor in my system
p7410
aVNumbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance\u000aI might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
p7411
aVNiggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian\u000aLamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale
p7412
aVAnd I never bend my morals for the ticket sales\u000aTippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL
p7413
aVI never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
p7414
aVRunnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts
p7415
aVI'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
p7416
aVThey think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
p7417
aVI still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room\u000aPaint a plan for the family debt, we in the minus
p7418
aVAnd like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us\u000aWhere you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
p7419
aVI'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
p7420
aVAnd my life is on display like Truman
p7421
aVThey wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
p7422
aVMy exes made some of my favorite music\u000aI dated women from my favorite movies\u000aKarma's such a thing of beauty
p7423
