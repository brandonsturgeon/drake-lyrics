aVThank you Ms. Graham for coming today. You look very nice today, sorry, that's not professional, I guess. They say in Canada, don't mingle business with pleasure, or something like that So, we have to talk about Aubrey, or how he likes to be called, Drake. As I always like to say, there is room for improvement in his learning from piano. He talks a lot, huh? He socialize when I'm teaching. Okay, and when it's time for him to play, he doesn't have pianist hands. If you need example: me, Mozart, and Ray Charles all of us have pianist hands. I'm the only one living with this hands, I guess. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding. Umm it seems like he likes the music and he obviously has a reason, but there is so much room for improvement, you know? Speaking of improvement, I don't think you, Ms. Graham need any of it. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding, haha

aVNow it's December, I'm driving, and she's like "Where's my hi?"
p5081
aVIt's weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy
p5082
aVSee that was a segue,
p5083
aVI believe the matter\u000aIs what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter
p5084
aVWhere the Timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up\u000aDrug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up\u000aWhere girls become exes from Summer's caught ho'in\u000aThe winter cars come out, the summer cars go in
p5085
aVAnd some places is breezy, and some it start snow-ing\u000aAnd if you planning family vacations you better know when
p5086
aVBut some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city\u000aInstead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity\u000aCause mom stays up late, she seen them videos\u000aWhere Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!

p5090
aVShe doesn't answer
p5091
aVopens the door and just gets in the seat\u000aShe throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat
p5092
aVShe's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet
p5093
aVThen she says "I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat\u000aI mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat\u000aI love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good\u000aThere's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat"
p5094
aVOff this I'm kinda takin it back for a second
p5095
aVI get her number she tells me to call her after this session
p5096
aVAnd so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch
p5097
aVUntil we end up sexin' and now my heart attached
p5098
aVI'm thinkin off I should've been more Southern
p5099
aVShe love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench

p5104
aVThe weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
p5105
aVWhen we were together it seeming like way back when\u000aBall players hop on the plane and make it way back in\u000aSee she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa
p5106
aVInstead of saving for marriage, she saving for carrabanna
p5107
aVAnd it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime\u000aI guess, I lost another one to the wintertime
p5108
aV(give me a second to gather my thoughts)\u000aAnd watching winter turn to spring (Such a beautiful day man)\u000a(Yeah man, you know we had to switch it on 'em right?)\u000aStrolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing\u000a(I'm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss)\u000a(Man, but I got something to else to tell ya baby)

aVMan, the good girls went silent on me\u000aThey got a boyfriend, or left for college on me\u000aAnd all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now\u000aThat make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
p5675
aVBut do I ever come up in discussion\u000aOver double pump lattes and low fat muffins?
p5676

p5678
aVThey hear about your cons, but focus on your pros\u000aAnd love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul

p5684
aVI'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?

p5694
aVI'm in a world where things are taken, never given
p5695
aVHow long they choose to love you will never be your decision\u000aAnd I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen\u000aSo while I'm still here in this position

p5708
aVBut without it all I'm still about the game
p5709
aVThe haters wanna hate, but it ain't no thing no\u000aBecause the ladies choose to love me (cause they love me for what I do)
p5710

Give some thought to this, because I\u2019m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days.

p6705
aVJust tell 'em you appreciate the help
p6706
aVBut you just got to know for yourself
p6707
aVSometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough\u000aTo feel what I'm about to say in this song
p6708
aVWhen they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself\u000aAnd you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
p6709
aVAnd they try to make you out as a lie
p6710
aVIt's ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason\u000aIt's a lose lose why even try
p6711
aVWhen your ideas so frequently get rejected
p6712
aVpeople just get neglected\u000aAnd they never really know how to feel
p6713
aVPhone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics\u000aAnd the motives to try and make them a mill
p6714
aVYou never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks
p6715
aVand\u000aNiggas wanna say that you ain't around
p6716
aVI mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming\u000aThat you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town
p6717
aVAnd the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin' is fresher\u000aThan most of these rappers running the game
p6718
aVCertain people will copy what's in the past to turn the profit with cash\u000aThere's time I would have done it the same
p6719
aVI mean I got me a Range, Also got me a guilty conscience\u000aThat made you tell anybody I meet that I rent
p6720
aVSometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers\u000aAnd watched the game from the bleachers
p6721
aVBecause I'm really tend to need what I spent
p6722
aVIn a house that I promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time\u000aI wasted out late at the club
p6723
aVInstead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I'm working hard on the winter\u000aSo this album is a labor of love
p6724
aVYou say as long as I'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats\u000aThat she can rest without a toss and a turn
p6725
aVBecause she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on TV\u000aThat's exactly why I often get burned
p6726
aVThat there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping
p6727
aVYou gonna try to try harder cuz
p6728
aVTry harder cuz
p6729
aVTry Try-Try-Try
p6730
aVBut I'm gonna try to..
p6731
aVYeah, 9th Wonder!
p6732
aVClaim we're early and be showing up extra late
p6733
aVThey don't be saying how I'm humble, I'm hella nice\u000aOr that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice
p6734
aVThey just tell you all the rumors they heard\u000aAnd we laugh soon as you come and tell me like Amel and Bryce\u000aMy groove theory
p6735
aVThat's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
p6736
aVAnd if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it
p6737
aVBut I hate it when they judge me on how I sound\u000aI mean I spit that influential shit from my town
p6738
aVYou probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and\u000aSwang dick to these hoes like nunchucks\u000aWell, you can think what you want but\u000aI think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut
p6739
aVYou need to get real and check out my real life\u000aI ain't a tip-drill, don't care what it smell like\u000aBut if you feel like putting all your notions aside\u000aAnd talking to a real nigga, I'd gladly oblige
p6740
aVFirst name Phonte, I'd be pleased to date ya\u000aCollege educated, got degrees in papers
p6741
aVMaybe with me you'll unlearn\u000aPutting all niggas in a box of concerns
p6742
aVThey say you never judge a book by its cover\u000aThough you appear as materialistic, just like the others
p6743
aVSo I followed your words to take 'em in\u000aAnd I don't see what you saying so they coming off paper thin\u000aThat's when I felt that I would need to\u000aDo more than just look you up and down to see if I could read you
p6744
aVYou only out for the paperback that's written all over your face\u000aNo El' will never judge a book by its cover
p6745
aVDon't judge me man
p6746
aVThey tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
p6747
aVThey say we lack substance
p6748
aVMe, 'Te and El' bout to prove 'em wrong though
p6749
aVUh, we know what you're thinking love
p6750
aVYou think we out smoking and drinking love
p6751
aVPushing big whips, chains clinking love
p6752
aVBut y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
p6753
aVWe know how you speculate
p6754
aVThinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
p6755
aV, love
p6756
aVis that when you too cheery
p6757
aVThey try to bring you down to the level they at
p6758
aVWell when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
p6759
aVBut, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart girl
p6760
aVNah, they probably think I'll break your heart girl
p6761
aVHaha, I can't lie, you probably right about it
p6762
aVI don't know why you sitting on the couch
p6763
aVWhen you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
p6764
aVYou think taking your purse off
p6765
aVWill lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
p6766
aVAt least I got status because I could've been a local emcee
p6767
aVAnd you probably would've been worse off
p6768
aVSo I'mma take this hat off, and I'mma hit it till I'm back soft
p6769
aVAnd then I backs off
p6770
aVCause you thinking you can predict what happen
p6771
aVYou the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping
p6772
aVBut I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping
p6773
aVOr rapping bout trapping you's a freak of nature
p6774
aVSuch an anomaly, speak so well
p6775
aVAnd talk so collegy, such an astonishing
p6776
aVContrast to all the bullshit you've been following
p6777
aVOn behalf of them, I offer my apologies
p6778
aVMe, cause I ain't dumb, shit I'm well read like sunburn
p6779
aVAnd after me you'll never leave no stone unturned
p6780
aVAnd try to get inside your head only
p6781
aVNot just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me
p6782
aVSo what I learned on my path to discover?
p6783
aVYour story took one ugly turn after another
p6784
aVI saw we wasn't on the same page
p6785
aVI would've gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way
p6786
aVSo now I'm closing the case
p6787
aVUntil he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under
p6788
aV(Crowd Talking)
p6789
aVOh, yes it's difficult\u000aThank God I'm Christian

p6791
aVYou were someone else's wife in fact\u000aYou didn't even look at me like that\u000aThen it all just switched, over time\u000aStep by step and you know what's next

aVI worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me

aVCeesay\u2019s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday
p6986
aVKiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray
p6987
aVI dropped out right before I graduate\u000aSix credits left, my mama had her saddest day\u000a"It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait"\u000aAnd she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
p6988
aVLately I just feel so out of character\u000aThe paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
p6989
aVThoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
p6990
aVI get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison\u000aI'm gettin' straight to the point with it
p6991
aVNeed y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas\u000aFuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition\u000aIt's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business\u000aBut I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute

aVLook, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals
p6993
aVMy niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
p6994
aVWho you think runnin' this show?\u000aYou saw it in me at 20 years old
p6995
aVThe lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code

p7000
aVNumbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance\u000aI might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
p7001
aVNiggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian\u000aLamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale
p7002
aVAnd I never bend my morals for the ticket sales\u000aTippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL
p7003
aVI never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
p7004
aVRunnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts
p7005
aVI'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
p7006
aVThey think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
p7007
aVI still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room\u000aPaint a plan for the family debt, we in the minus
p7008
aVAnd like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us\u000aWhere you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
p7009
aVI'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
p7010
aVAnd my life is on display like Truman
p7011
aVThey wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
p7012
aVMy exes made some of my favorite music\u000aI dated women from my favorite movies\u000aKarma's such a thing of beauty
p7013
aVI'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it\u000aIt's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
p7014
aVI keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever
p7015
aVI might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
p7016
aVIf I was you, I wouldn't like me either
p7017
aVThe first time I saw you
p7018
aVI thought you were barefoot
p7019
aVYour hair was pulled back, your jelly shoes, I was wondering if I should
p7020
aVLie
p7021
aVAbout my age
p7022
aVBuddy Holly glasses on a Betty Page negative
p7023
aVYou're looking so classic handpicked by some Hollywood executive
p7024
aVJust like Norma Jean
p7025
aVI can't believe I've fallen for you
p7026
aVWay oh
p7027
aVThe next time I saw you, you asked for a reason
p7028
aVI let my love come down
p7029
aVNow you're spending all your time thinking how you're gonna get even
p7030
aVAnd I'm by myself
p7031
aVGood morning now
p7032
aVIt's a good morning
p7033
aVThe Hollywood ending it never came easy
p7034
aVThe bride to be can plainly see and now she says she's ready to kill me
p7035
aVAnd I'm so afraid
p7036
aVWhat up, Lupe?\u000aChi-Town, check
p7037
aVMy style is very Tennessee mixed with some Terry Kennedy
p7038
aVPeople barely remember me from back in the day
p7039
aVI done got some contacts and threw the glasses away\u000aThe time it took me to get cool was a massive delay
p7040
aVIt gets boring growing up in Memphis\u000aTryna become a pro, but keep showing up apprentice
p7041
aVMama probably would've done anything to prevent this\u000aCause every single time I break a board, it gets expensive
p7042
aVLuckily, my aunt workin' as a nurse\u000aSo every time I needed something, she just reach up in her purse
p7043
aVAnd plus, she'd always give me speeches on the first\u000aIf I'm stayin' in her house, then I need to get some work
p7044
aVI tell her I was there on vacation\u000aShe said, "You need to be doing something other than skatin'
p7045
aVWhy don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement?\u000aI'mma let him know that you comin', honey, he's waitin'"
p7046
aVPlaying chess, looking through some old school record ads
p7047
aVHe knew I didn't really wanna post here\u000aOpened up the window and told me that the coast clear
p7048
aVThis is each test life's ever given me\u000aA-plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
p7049
aVYes, I'm literally Larnell Lewis with a\u000aKick and a snare, a kickflip in the air
p7050
aVThe kid's sick denim jeans, put a rip in a pair\u000aJust so the space ain't restricted in here, breathe again
p7051
aVThink it's obvious that they need my soul
p7052
aVMy cousin's after Doe, like re-mi-fa-so
p7053
aVI said, "Auntie, this is a safe career"\u000aShe said, "Drake, I told you there was no skatin' here"
p7054
aV, but check
p7055
aVSo now, it's me in old school checkered plaid
p7056
aVAnd now I coast clear, take a deep breath
p7057
aVFeeling like the Pope's here, homie, this is recess
p7058
aVSo I kick, push
p7059
aVKick, push
p7060
aVCoast
p7061
aVFast as the wheels replaced
p7062
aVI gotta find another hobby just to fill the space
p7063
aVPeep the way I roll
p7064
aVJust a rebel, lookin' for a place to go
p7065
aVSo I kick
p7066
aVThen push
p7067
aVAnd coast
p7068
aVAnd that champagne so fuchsia baby
p7069
aVI'll wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
p7070
aVTouch right there, whatever the speeds at\u000aIf it's over fast then I promise you will relapse
p7071
aVJust charge that cell that I message you on
p7072
aVHalf of that's ice and the rest is Patron
p7073
aVCause mines it Polo and yours is Vickie\u000aAnd they just spread all over the floor like
p7074
aVMe and you so crucial baby
p7075
aVI do things that you ain't use to baby
p7076
aVAnd take you back home to St. Lucia baby
p7077
aVWhen raindrops hit the tan roof its crazy
p7078
aVThat's a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
p7079
aVWhen you are wet and covered in sweat
p7080
aVI love all my feedback
p7081
aVTell me to give it to ya if you need that
p7082
aVForget what you guess that I'm on and who is in your past
p7083
aVI'm refreshing and grown
p7084
aVAnd if you lets us girl, I'mma bring the dressing along
p7085
aVYou hear that professional tone?
p7086
aVShow up on time for the class I'm teaching
p7087
aVCause guaranteed I'mma bring a lesson along
p7088
aVAnd you just gotta bring the breastes along
p7089
aVInstead of holding out wondering what it coulda been
p7090
aVI confess this address to you
p7091
aVAnd I'm the post man looking for a slot I can put it in
p7092
aVWith no New York number mom still upstairs
p7093
aVI'm two floors under but my room's sound proof
p7094
